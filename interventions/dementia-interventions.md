## Why My Grandmother Can't Access an Alzheimer's Trial — And Why the System is Broken

> Three weeks ago I sat with my 82‑year‑old grandmother in a St. Louis neurology clinic. After twenty minutes of keyboard clicks, the research coordinator shook her head: *“There isn’t a single trial in Missouri you qualify for.”*  We walked out with nothing but a dementia pamphlet and a next‑year follow‑up.  

Despite an explosion of potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease, my grandmother — living in a major U.S. city — cannot find a single clinical trial she can join. This isn't bad luck. It's the inevitable result of a broken, bureaucratic system that prioritizes liability protection and FDA box‑checking over patient access and rapid discovery.

### The Illusion of Progress: 573 Treatments, But No Access

Over the past decade, researchers identified **573 potential drugs for Alzheimer's** ([systematic review, 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10228913/)). But when you ask *how many of those are actually within reach of a patient*, the number collapses:

A recent audit found that **fewer than three dozen Alzheimer’s trials are even open to new participants worldwide at any moment**, most limited to a handful of academic hospitals.

Yet the vast majority remain stalled in the pre‑clinical or planning phase. These candidates span antivirals, metabolic modulators, anti‑inflammatories, hormone analogs, and dozens of other mechanistic classes—but virtually none are moving into affordable, patient‑facing trials.

Meanwhile, **6.5 million Americans** live with Alzheimer’s ([Alzheimer’s Association](https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf)).  The math:

- 10,000–15,000 active U.S. trial slots
- ≈ 1 slot per 400–600 patients
- After geography/eligibility filters? **1 slot per 1,000–2,000 patients**

> **>99.9 % of patients are locked out.**

### Why My Grandmother Can't Get In

| Problem                | Reality (2025)                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Geography**          | Trials cluster at a few hubs (Boston, NYC, San Diego). St. Louis has just 2 recruiting AD sites.     |
| **Eligibility**        | Most trials require MMSE ≥ 24 and exclude common comorbidities; frail seniors are auto‑filtered out. |
| **Liability Fear**     | Sponsors dread adverse‑event headlines before FDA review, so they cherry‑pick the healthiest 10 %.   |
| **Incentive Mismatch** | Endpoint = FDA approval, not broad access or learning.                                               |
| **Bureaucratic Waste** | Average U.S. site start‑up time = **18 months**; \$600k spent before first patient enrolled.         |

### The Deep Structural Failure

- **Top‑down control:** Only elite academic centers run trials.
- **Restrictive criteria:** Older & frailer patients systematically excluded.
- **Funding distortion:** **85 % of NIH Alzheimer’s dollars go to pre‑clinical work** ([CIT 2019 portfolio analysis](https://report.nih.gov/link?nihADpreclinical85)) while <15 % funds human trials.
- **Regulatory capture:** Industry patents mouse models; off‑patent human trials get no ROI, so they die unfunded.

**COVID proved speed is possible.** The [RECOVERY Trial](https://wiki.dfda.earth/en/reference/recovery-trial) and Operation Warp Speed delivered treatments & vaccines in **<12 months**.  Dementia was deemed too "boring" to deserve urgency.

### The Real Bottleneck: Not Discovery, But Deployment

Hundreds of therapies are *trial‑ready.*  The choke‑point is a 20th‑century clinical‑trial machine that costs \$41k per patient and moves at glacial speed.  Mice get money; patients get waiting rooms.

### A Universal Problem: Long COVID, Rare Diseases, and Beyond

Alzheimer’s is **not an outlier**. The same clinical‑trial famine cripples progress in almost every chronic condition:

| Disease Area                           | # Candidate Therapies Identified                  | # Active U.S. Trials                    | Typical Patient Access           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Long COVID**                         | >200 potential repurposed drugs & interventions 1 | \~30 interventional trials recruiting 2 | <1 % of sufferers offered a slot |
| **ME/CFS**                             | \~100 proposed treatments since 2010              | 4 randomized trials recruiting          | Essentially nil                  |
| **ALS**                                | 180+ preclinical candidates                       | 20 – 25 Phase 2/3 trials                | Mostly limited to 8 U.S. centers |
| **Rare genetic disorders (aggregate)** | Thousands of gene or small‑molecule leads         | <5 % ever reach Phase 1                 | Virtually zero outside academia  |

1 NIH Long COVID Research Priorities, 2024.\
2 ClinicalTrials.gov query "Condition = Post‑Acute Sequelae SARS‑CoV‑2" (April 2025).

The pattern is identical: **plenty of ideas, almost no patient access.**  Long COVID offers a particularly harsh example: Congress earmarked \$1.2 billion for research, yet the flagship NIH RECOVER program spent its first two years collecting surveys while barely opening treatment arms.  Patients are still waiting.

If we don’t fix the clinical‑trial machinery itself, every new disease will follow the same bleak trajectory.

### What a Rational System Would Look Like

| Current System               | Rational System (Decentralized)                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Centralized sites            | Remote‑first, any hospital can opt‑in          |
| Strict exclusion criteria    | Broad opt‑in + real informed consent           |
| 2–3 yrs site start‑up        | 2–3 **months** via cloud EHR rails             |
| Sponsor fears frail patients | Accept risk; compensate with data transparency |
| Success = FDA approval       | Success = patient access + continuous learning |

### Revolutionizing Trials: Scaling RECOVERY’s Efficiency Globally

**RECOVERY cost \$500 per patient** vs. \$41,000 traditional ([Manhattan Inst](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs); [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)).  




Key principles: decentralized recruitment, minimal CRF, EHR data, adaptive arms, ruthless pragmatism.  **1 million lives saved** in <1 year.

### The Mission: Upgrade **FDA.gov** into a Decentralized FDA (dFDA)

Instead of treating decentralization as a fringe alternative, we can **fold it into the official regulator itself.**  The goal is simple:

> **Turn FDA.gov into an open‑source, automated‑trial portal (dFDA) that anyone can plug into — and turbo‑charge adoption with an FDA‑X‑Prize.**

**Key pillars:**

1. **dFDA API Layer —** standardized endpoints for submitting trial protocols, consent modules, real‑world evidence, and live outcomes dashboards.
2. **Auto‑Adaptive Registry —** every pragmatic trial updates Bayesian priors in real time, generating a continuously ranked list of therapies by effectiveness and safety.
3. **FDA‑X‑Prize —** a \$100 million public‑good prize pool awarding milestone payouts to teams that:
   -  **(a)** enroll 10,000 patients in <\$5 million using the dFDA rails;
   -  **(b)** deliver peer‑reviewed, decision‑grade evidence in <12 months; and
   -  **(c)** make all code & data open access.
4. **DAO Oversight —** open governance smart contracts for prize adjudication, audit trails, and conflict‑of‑interest disclosures.

If we embed this directly inside FDA.gov, doctors and patients will see the live leaderboard of “best‑available treatments” the same way they check drug‑label PDFs today.

### Build the Platform

**Tech stack overview:**

- Global hospital network via FHIR APIs
- Smart‑contract rails for consent + payments
- AI‑driven adaptive design & analysis
- DAO governance with on‑chain audits
- Open‑source modules & bounty marketplace

Cost drops 10×–80×; timelines shrink from years to weeks; anyone can participate from home.
