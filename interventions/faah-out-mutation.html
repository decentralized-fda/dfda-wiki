<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>FAAH-OUT is a gene that has been associated with a rare genetic mutation that causes its carrier to live virtually pain-free, heal more rapidly, and experience r<a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/study-reveals-unique-molecular-machinery-of-woman-who-can-t-feel-pain">educed anxiety and fear</a>.&nbsp;The mutation in FAAH-OUT 'turns down' FAAH gene expression, which leads to <a href="https://www.biologyonline.com/articles/faah-out-mutation-for-a-life-of-no-pain-no-faah-no-pain">increased levels of anandamide</a>, a fatty acid neurotransmitter.&nbsp;This results in reduced pain sensation, as <a href="https://www.biologyonline.com/articles/faah-out-mutation-for-a-life-of-no-pain-no-faah-no-pain">observed</a>&nbsp;in FAAH knockout mice.&nbsp;The mutation also affects other molecular pathways linked to <a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/study-reveals-unique-molecular-machinery-of-woman-who-can-t-feel-pain">wound healing and mood</a>.</p>
<p>By manipulating the FAAH-OUT gene or its associated pathways, it may be possible to develop treatments that reduce pain, anxiety, and fear in n humans and animals. This could have significant implications for individuals suffering from chronic pain or mental health disorders and animals subjected to the harsh conditions of <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/factory-farming-animal-cruelty">factory farming</a>.<br><br><a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awad098/7169317?login=false">One recent study</a> has illustrated the use of a plasmid gene delivery mechanism to do a microdeletion in FAAH-OUT and detailed the reduced FAAH activity and mechanistic basis for the phenotype effects.</p>
<h1>How the FAAH gene increases pain sensitivity</h1>
<ol>
  <li>The FAAH (<strong>fatty acid amide hydrolase)</strong> gene encodes for the FAAH enzyme.</li>
  <li>FAAH normally degrades anandamide (<i>a fatty acid neurotransmitter</i>) into <i>free arachidonic acid</i> and <i>ethanolamine</i>.</li>
  <li>Without <i>FAAH</i>, the levels of anandamide would increase significantly.</li>
  <li>This, in turn, leads to a reduced pain sensation.</li>
  <li><i>FAAH</i> knockout mice demonstrated the absence of pain, reduced anxiety, and faster wound healing.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Case report: Microdeletion in a <i>FAAH</i> pseudogene identified in a patient with high anandamide concentrations and pain insensitivity</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The study of rare families with inherited <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/analgesia-sensory-dysfunction">pain insensitivity</a> can identify new human-validated <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anodyne">analgesic drug</a> targets.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here, a 66-yr-old female presented with nil requirement for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/postoperative-analgesia">postoperative analgesia</a> after a normally painful orthopaedic hand surgery (trapeziectomy). Further investigations revealed a lifelong history of painless injuries, such as frequent cuts and burns, which were observed to heal quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>the co-inheritance of&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i) a microdeletion in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dorsal-root">dorsal root</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ganglion">ganglia</a> and brain-expressed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pseudogene">pseudogene</a>, <i>FAAH-OUT</i>, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fatty-acid-amidase"><i>FAAH</i></a>) chromosomal region; and</p>
  <p>(ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in <i>FAAH</i> conferring reduced expression and activity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Circulating concentrations of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anandamide">anandamide</a> and related fatty-acid <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/carboxamide">amides</a> (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endocannabinoid">endocannabinoid</a> signalling and a loss of function of FAAH.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our results highlight previously unknown complexity at the <i>FAAH</i> genomic locus involving the expression of <i>FAAH-OUT</i>, a novel pseudogene and long non-coding RNA. These data suggest new routes to develop <i>FAAH</i>-based analgesia by targeting of <i>FAAH-OUT</i>, which could significantly improve the treatment of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/postoperative-pain">postoperative pain</a> and potentially chronic pain and anxiety disorders.</p>

<h1>Methods for Producing Test Subjects</h1>
<p>To produce animals with the same full genotype as Cameron (heterozygous hypomorphic mutation in FAAH and microdeletion in FAAH-OUT), the following methods can be used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Genetic engineering of animal embryos: CRISPR-Cas9 technology can introduce the specific mutations found in Cameron's FAAH and FAAH-OUT genes into animal embryos. This involves designing guide RNAs that target specific sites in the genome, which are then used to introduce the desired mutations.</li>
  <li>Embryo implantation and breeding: The genetically modified embryos are implanted into surrogate animals, which carry the pregnancy to term. The resulting offspring will have the desired genetic modifications. These animals can then be bred to produce a larger population with the same genotype.</li>
  <li>Genotyping: The resulting animals should be genotyped to confirm their desired FAAH and FAAH-OUT mutations.</li>
  <li>Control group: A control group of animals with the normal FAAH and FAAH-OUT genotypes should also be produced using the same methods to ensure that any observed differences between the experimental and control groups are due to genetic modifications and not other factors.</li>
  <li>Ethical considerations: Ensure all genetic engineering is conducted per ethical guidelines and obtain necessary regulatory approvals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these methods, it is possible to produce animal models with the same complete genotype as Cameron, which can be used to assess the effects of this genotype on various physiological and behavioral parameters.</p>
<h1>Experimental protocol</h1>
<p>Experimental protocol for testing the effects of Cameron's full FAAH and FAAH-OUT genotype in common animal models:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Animal selection: Select a common animal model species that is widely used in the industry, such as pigs or chickens, and obtain animals from a reputable supplier.</li>
  <li>Genotyping: Genotype the animals to confirm their FAAH and FAAH-OUT status. Animals with the same genotype as Cameron (i.e., a heterozygous hypomorphic mutation in FAAH and microdeletion in FAAH-OUT) should be selected for the experimental group.</li>
  <li>Behavioral testing: Conduct behavioral tests to assess the animals' response to various stressors, such as loud noises, bright lights, and physical restraint. Record the animals' behavior and measure physiological responses such as heart rate and cortisol levels.</li>
  <li>Pain sensitivity testing: Test the animals' pain sensitivity using established methods such as the hot plate or tail flick tests. Record the animals' response time and behavioral signs of pain.</li>
  <li>Wound healing time: Induce a standardized wound in the animals and measure the time it takes for the wound to heal completely. Record any signs of pain or discomfort during the healing process.</li>
  <li>TRPV1 sensitivity testing: Conduct TRPV1 sensitivity testing to determine if FAAH KO increases animal sensitivity. This can be done using established methods such as the von Frey filament test. If TRPV1 sensitivity is increased, test the effects of TRPV1 inhibition on pain and anxiety levels in the animals.</li>
  <li>Statistical analysis: Analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods to determine if there are significant differences between the experimental group and the control group.</li>
  <li>Ethical considerations: Ensure that all animal experimentation follows ethical guidelines and obtains necessary regulatory approvals.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following this experimental protocol, we can assess the potential effects of Cameron's full FAAH and FAAH-OUT genotype in common animal models and determine if it could be a viable approach for reducing suffering in industrial contexts.</p>
