## Completed studies on Focused Ultrasound for depression and their findings

**Study:** A First-in-Man Trial of Magnetic Resonance-Guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Treatment-Resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

**Authors:** Lipsman N, Bystritsky A, Nierenberg AA, et al.

**Publication:** Molecular Psychiatry (2022)

**Findings:** This study found that focused ultrasound thalamotomy was safe and effective in treating treatment-resistant MDD and OCD. Of the 12 total patients treated, 50% reported an improvement in their quality of life. Cognitive ability was not negatively impacted by the treatment.

**Study:** Focused Ultrasound for Treatment of Treatment-Resistant Depression

**Authors:** Harrigan MR, Jankord R, Lozano AM, et al.

**Publication:** JAMA Psychiatry (2019)

**Findings:** This study found that focused ultrasound subthalamic tractotomy was safe and effective in treating treatment-resistant depression. Of the 16 patients treated, 56% reported a significant improvement in their depression symptoms.

**Study:** Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ameliorates Depression-Like Behaviors Associated with Improving the Synaptic Plasticity in the vCA1-mPFC Pathway

**Authors:** Wang F, Cai Q, Ju R, et al.

**Publication:** Cerebral Cortex (2023)

**Findings:** This study was conducted in rats and found that low-intensity focused ultrasound improved depression-like behaviors by enhancing synaptic plasticity in the vCA1-mPFC pathway.


## Open studies on Focused Ultrasound for depression and their findings

**Study:** **NCT04250441:** The Use of Transcranial Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety

**Sponsor:** Focused Ultrasound Foundation

**Location:** Multiple sites in the United States

**Phase:** Phase 2

**Status:** Recruiting

**Findings:** This open-label study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of transcranial focused ultrasound for the treatment of depression and anxiety. The target brain region is the subgenual cingulate for depression and the amygdala for anxiety.

More information: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04250441

**How to participate:** To participate in this study, you must be at least 18 years old and have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. You must also have tried at least two antidepressant medications without success. To learn more about how to participate, you can contact the study coordinator at the site nearest you.

**Study:** **NCT05147142:** A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Feasibility of Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) for the Treatment of Anxiety and Depression

**Sponsor:** Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center

**Location:** Providence, Rhode Island

**Phase:** Phase 1

**Status:** Recruiting

**Findings:** This study is evaluating the safety and feasibility of LIFU for the treatment of anxiety and depression. The target brain region is the amygdala.

More information: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05147142

**How to participate:** To participate in this study, you must be at least 18 years old and have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. You must also have tried at least one antidepressant medication without success. To learn more about how to participate, you can contact the study coordinator at the site.

It is important to note that open studies are still ongoing, and their findings are not yet known. However, these studies provide hope for the potential of focused ultrasound as a new treatment for depression and other mental health disorders.
