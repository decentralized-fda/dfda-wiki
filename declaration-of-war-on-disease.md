# Declaration of War on Disease

## Preamble: The Battle Cry of Our Generation

We the People of Earth, recognizing the fundamental right to life and health, hereby declare total war against all preventable disease and unnecessary suffering. Where previous generations accepted sickness as inevitable, we choose revolution through [decentralized clinical trials](blueprint/blueprint.md) and [real-world evidence](02-solution.md).

## Articles of Engagement

### I. Recognition of Failed Systems
- **Clinical Research Crisis:** $2.6B drug development costs ([01-problem.md](01-problem.md)) sacrifice 150,000 daily lives to process delays  
- **Regulatory Capture:** 17-year approval timelines ([benefits/time-to-treatment.md](benefits/time-to-treatment.md)) violate basic human rights  
- **Economic Perversion:** $7T sickcare industry profits from [chronic treatment over cures](02-solution.md#cost-savings-in-drug-development)  
- **Technological Failure:** 350,000 duplicate health apps ([01-problem.md](01-problem.md#321-157-billion-wasted-on-duplication-of-effort)) vs zero cure progress databases  

### II. Principles of the New Order
1. **Patient Sovereignty:** [100% trial participation](benefits/patient-participation.md) through decentralized protocols  
2. **Data Armamentarium:** [Global Health Unifier](agents/global-health-unifier.md) coordinates planetary research efforts  
3. **Algorithmic Justice:** [dFDA rankings](blueprint/blueprint.md#a-global-decentralized-autonomous-algorithmic-fda) replace bureaucratic approval  
4. **Profit Realignment:** [50/50 savings sharing](blueprint/blueprint.md#3-incentivizing-cures-instead-of-chronic-disease) makes cures 20X more valuable  
5. **Open Science Warfare:** All research under [Open Science License](community_directory/open-source-projects/open-source-projects.md)  

### III. Strategic Objectives
| Target | Current | 2027 Goal | Tactics |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Trial Costs | $41k/participant | $1,500 | [Automated trials](benefits/lower-costs.md) |
| Treatment Lag | 17 years | 2 years | [Right to Trial Act](right-to-trial-act.md) |
| Trial Participation | 15% eligible | 100% | [Decentralized infrastructure](blueprint/blueprint.md) |
| Chronic Disease Burden | $4.1T USD | -50% | [Prevention bounties](blueprint/blueprint-gas.md) |

### IV. Rules of Engagement
- **Article 1:** Universal [Right to Trial access](right-to-trial-act.md) for all patients  
- **Article 2:** [50/50 savings sharing](blueprint/blueprint.md#3-incentivizing-cures-instead-of-chronic-disease) for verified QALY improvements  
- **Article 3:** [Study Review Agents](agents/study-review-agent.md) replace human bias in validation  
- **Article 4:** [Open source collaboration](community_directory/open-source-projects/open-source-projects.md) mandated for all health tech  
- **Article 5:** [Global referendum](blueprint/blueprint.md#global-referendum-on-disease-eradication) required for major policy changes  

## Call to Arms

### For Researchers
- Deploy [decentralized trial protocols](blueprint/blueprint.md) with 95% cost reductions  
- Claim bounties from [prevented QALY losses](benefits/faster-progress.md)  
- Bypass journals through [real-time data sharing](02-solution.md#overcoming-the-no-control-group-problem)  

### For Patients
- Become [Citizen Scientists](benefits/patient-participation.md) in global trials  
- Claim ownership through [health data DAOs](community_directory/community_volunteers/README.md)  
- Demand [experimental access](right-to-trial-act.md) via blockchain petitions  

### For Institutions
- Redirect $700B lobbying to [cure bounties](blueprint/blueprint-gas.md)  
- Replace IRBs with [Automated Ethics Review](agents/study-review-agent.md)  
- Adopt [War Footing Procurement](blueprint/blueprint.md#phase-3-global-implementation) protocols  

## Final Ultimatum

To the Disease Industrial Complex: Your 10-year trials become our 6-month validations. Your excluded patients become our army of citizen scientists. Your profit centers become our bounties for eradication.
