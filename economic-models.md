## Comparative Analysis

Looking across all analyses, we see the following ranges:

1. **Investment Requirements**
   - Initial Investment: $1.15B - $26.3B
   - Annual Operating Costs: $1B - $12B

2. **Expected Returns**
   - ROI Range: 9:1 - 31,583%
   - Net Benefits Range: $45B - $3.79T
   - Benefit-Cost Ratios: 9:1 - 37:1

3. **Implementation Timelines**
   - Short-term (5 years): $52.1B in benefits (Perplexity)
   - Medium-term (10 years): $406B - $3.79T in benefits
   - Breakeven: 2-3 years (consensus)

4. **Scale of Impact**
   - Global Participation: 1B+ users
   - Annual Trial Capacity: 2M+ participants
   - Drug Approval Rate: 3-4x increase

While methodologies and specific projections vary, all analyses consistently show:
- Massive cost reduction per trial participant

   - 80x reduction in per-patient costs

2. **Accelerated Development**
   - Current approval time: 7-10 years
   - Projected approval time: 2.5-5 years
   - 50-70% reduction in development timeline

3. **Increased Trial Participation**
   - Current participation: <5% of eligible patients
   - Projected participation: Up to 1B+ participants globally
   - Dramatically improved statistical power and diversity

4. **Economic Benefits**
   - Increased drug approvals (3x-4x current rate)
   - Reduced development costs
   - Faster time to market
   - Better treatment optimization
   - Global accessibility improvements

While the specific numbers vary between analyses, all models indicate substantial positive ROI and transformative benefits for global healthcare through decentralized clinical trials.
