# How to Create a Task

1. Click the [Issues](https://github.com/anonymous-dao/draft-whitepaper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) tab
2. Search to see if the task already exists
3. If it already exists, click it and up-vote it as described ðŸ‘‰ [here](vote-on-tasks-and-sort-by-priority.md)
4. If not, click the `New issue` button
5. Describe in as much detail as possible and add any tags that you think will be helpful in filtering and sorting
