CureDAO is a DAO helping create personalized precision medicine of the future by establishing an open-source platform for health data.

Help mitigate the incidence of chronic illnesses by informing users of symptom triggers, such as dietary sensitivities.

This will also assist patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive experiment.

## Benefits
A share of 10% of the total outstanding CureDAO tokens, proportional to your hourly rate and number of hours invested.

Based on comparable health DAO launches, this would likely lead to far greater compensation than your standard rate.

### Other benefits include
- Partake in governance decisions
- Flexible remote work hours


## Responsibilities
- Improve our time-series data mining algorithms to quantify correlations between every combination of variables for a given individual
- Design algorithms capable of determining the minimum quantities of nutrient intake, sleep, exercise, medications, and other factors necessary to minimize symptom severity


## Qualifications
- Strong willingness to learn and grow
- Excited to play a leading role in using data to identify causal relationships using irregular time series data
- Great problem solver
- Passionate about our vision
- You are experienced in all aspects of designing, implementing, and scaling the architecture to process large amounts of data
