CureDAO is a DAO helping create personalized precision medicine of the future by establishing an open-source platform for health data.

This will also assist patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive experiment.

## Benefits
A share of 10% of the total outstanding CureDAO tokens, proportional to your hourly rate and number of hours invested.

Based on comparable health DAO launches, this would likely lead to far greater compensation than your standard rate.

### Other benefits include
- Partake in governance decisions
- Flexible remote work hours


## Responsibilities
- Shorten the software development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality


## Qualifications
- Strong willingness to learn and grow
- Great problem solver
- Working with cloud hosting platforms such as AWS, and modern deployment tools
- Passionate about our vision
- Enjoying the detective work of solving server problems through the strategic use of metrics and logging
