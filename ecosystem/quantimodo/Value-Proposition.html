<h1 style="text-align:justify;">Value Proposition</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Developers</h2>
<p>App creators and quantified self-start-ups can save months of development time and tens of thousands of dollars by using our platform instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Telemedicine</h2>
<p>Insights from self-tracking data can bring telemedicine into the mainstream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Corporate Wellness</h2>
<p>Keep employees happy, healthy, and engaged by creating an effective wellness program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Patients and Consumer End Users</h2>
<p>The platform and its applications provide significant value to end-users and clinicians. Nearly half of Americans suffer from at least one chronic condition, and the number is growing. The severity of many of these conditions such as arthritis, depression, hypertension, ADHD, anxiety, and diabetes can be influenced by hundreds of factors in daily life. Human minds do not have the bandwidth or statistical processing power required to account for all these factors, their synergistic relationships, and the time delays before their effects are observed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We turn this cacophony of life-tracking data into actionable insights.&nbsp; It does this by aggregating and mining it using machine learning algorithms to determine what an individual can do to optimize any quantifiable aspect of human life such as mood, sleep, cognitive performance, cardiovascular health, and productivity. It then presents this information to the user in the form of a search engine, mobile notifications, and a personal analytics dashboard.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Example Areas of Life Optimization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mood</li>
  <li>Grades</li>
  <li>Childâ€™s behavior</li>
  <li>Productivity</li>
  <li>Weight</li>
  <li>Chronic pain</li>
  <li>Blood pressure</li>
  <li>Sleep</li>
</ul>

  <li>Am I poisoning my kids by feeding them foods containing ingredients that may be adversely affecting their health?</li>
  <li>What type of food is most dangerous/healthy for me?</li>
  <li>What are the best supplements/alternative health therapies for my condition?</li>
  <li>How late in the day can I still drink coffee without it affecting my sleeping quality?</li>
  <li>What is the optimal time that I should sleep and wake?</li>
  <li>What time of day should I take vitamin D3 and omega 3? Does it matter?</li>
  <li>What factors could be causing my stomach cramps?</li>
  <li>Does food in the evening affect sleep?</li>
  <li>Which behaviors are the most key to my happiness?</li>
  <li>If I exercise in the morning before work, does that lead to a more productive day at the office?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Identify food sensitivities</li>
  <li>Identify hidden triggers of illness</li>
  <li>Personalized effectiveness rates of treatments</li>
  <li>Clinical Support: Data aggregation services for clinicians to diagnose, treat, and monitor patients</li>

<h2>Hospitals</h2>
<p>We offer a cloud-based data integration platform that enables providers and patients to input digital health data through disparate wearables, applications, and devices. This enables payers to then access and analyzes the data via a single, integrated platform.&nbsp; By helping health-related organizations aggregate and analyze data from the continuously expanding list of digital health technologies, QuAnTiMoDo enables healthcare companies to better coordinate care across their communities, improve their patient engagement strategies, and more efficiently manage their patient populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One in five elderly patients is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of leaving, according to government data. Readmissions of Missouri Medicare patients alone cost $500 million annually, with $34 million paying for trips that could be prevented. Inadequate monitoring of post-discharge patients is one of the main causes of readmissions. Many are being discharged without fully understanding their treatment plans and, as a result, do not stay adherent to prescribed medications. Fortunately, the majority of readmissions are preventable.&nbsp; We have a patient treatment and side effect monitoring platform reducing hospital readmissions (and resulting fines) focusing on patient-centric post-discharge care coordination and remote telehealth monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Researchers</h2>
<p>The Research Platform makes it far easier and cheaper to conduct research than ever before.&nbsp; The researcher simply creates a Study Group, then explain the rationale for their study, and invites others to join the study, thereby granting anonymous access to data for the relevant variables. &nbsp; This technology can also be used to dramatically drive down the costs of collecting and analyzing data to be used in clinical and pharmaceutical post-marketing research, which are currently as high as $48,000 per subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Insurance Companies</h2>
<p>Furthermore, this new digital health solution would help to drive down costs for insurance providers.&nbsp; Health plan providers need a more personalized approach to help their members and have found a way to do so with the provider and patient-reported digital health data. By incorporating this data into a centralized repository, payers can analyze and use this information to create and improve their various member services. For example, in addition to supporting patient-specific care management models, integrated data could enable the creation of wellness programs, preventive or disease-management care initiatives, or even health-coaching programs. This personalized data can go beyond incentivizing and motivating healthy lifestyles; it can also help payers increase member engagement, a critical objective for a good deal of health plan providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pharmaceutical Companies</h2>
<p>106,000 people die annually in the U.S. from properly prescribed drugs.&nbsp; The number of people having in-hospital, adverse reactions to prescribed drugs is 2.2 million per year. The total number of deaths caused by conventional medicine is 783,936 per year. &nbsp; Pharmaceutical companies spend over $2 billion a year on over 314,000 events attended by doctors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial sponsor applications focus on tracking adverse reactions to the medications known to produce the most adverse reactions. &nbsp; Our treatment and symptom tracking application can reduce the number of deaths and costs of intervention by alerting patients and their practitioners to conditions before they become irreversible.&nbsp; Additionally, the opportunity to meet and promote these applications to physicians would also serve as a novel new way for pharmaceutical manufacturers to connect with physicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technology can also be used to dramatically drive down the costs of pharmaceutical post-marketing research.</p>
