<h3><strong>Implementation Costs</strong></h3>
<p>The implementation costs for decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) vary depending on the trial phase. On average, the implementation cost is $473,000 for a phase II DCT trial and $1,042,000 for a phase III DCT tria<sup>l</sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43441-022-00454-5"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></a>. These costs include adopting remote and virtual methods, technologies, and infrastructure to conduct the trial.</p>
<h3><strong>Study Administration Costs</strong></h3>
<p>Study administration costs can account for 11% to 29% of study budgets<a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/08/5-ways-that-decentralized-clinical-trial-approaches-can-reduce-study-costs/"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></a>. These costs include employee time (administrative staff, clinical staff, etc.) and site location-specific costs like diagnostic testing and imaging. As the number of sites and participants increases, these costs also increase.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology Investments</strong></h3>
<p>Investing in technology is crucial for the successful implementation of DCTs. This includes electronic data capture systems, remote monitoring, risk-based monitoring, and data management<a href="https://www.medidata.com/en/life-science-resources/medidata-blog/easier-decentralized-clinical-trial-implementation/"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></a>. The costs associated with implementing wearable technologies, such as purchasing hardware, developing software, and paying for data storage and analysis, also contribute to the overall technology investment<a href="https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/decentralized-clinical-trials-what-are-the-opportunities-for-data-cost-savings-0001"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Recruitment and Retention</strong></h3>
<p>Recruitment and retention are significant challenges in clinical trials. On average, it costs $6,533 to recruit one patient to a clinical study, and the cost of replacing patients is even higher, with an average cost of $19,533 per new patient if one is lost due to non-compliance<a href="https://mdgroup.com/blog/the-true-cost-of-patient-drop-outs-in-clinical-trials/"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></a>. Decentralized clinical trials can help improve patient retention by making trial participation more accessible and less burdensome<a href="https://www.iqvia.com/blogs/2021/03/can-decentralized-clinical-trials-solve-attrition"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Site Costs</strong></h3>
<p>Site costs include funds for clinical trial site startups, administrative costs, fees for adding or removing sites, and storage fees for trial records<a href="https://www.cloudbyz.com/resources/clinical-trial-budget-management/clinical-trial-budgeting-6-different-costs-to-consider-2021/"><strong>7</strong></a>. In multicenter clinical trial sites, budgets must account for all sites and manage the cost for single sites, such as per-patient enrollment, starting up the trial, and study close-out costs. In summary, the typical costs associated with running a decentralized clinical trial include implementation costs, study administration costs, technology investments, recruitment and retention, and site costs. While some aspects of DCTs may initially require more investment, the potential benefits of improved patient access, reduced burden, and increased efficiency can lead to overall cost savings and better outcomes in the long run<a href="https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2022/07/28/investment-in-decentralized-clinical-trials-pays-off-analysis"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></a></p>
