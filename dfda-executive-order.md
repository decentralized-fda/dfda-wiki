**TRANSFORMING THE FDA INTO A DECENTRALIZED, PATIENT-CENTRIC PLATFORM TO ACCELERATE MEDICAL INNOVATION AND EXPAND ACCESS TO SAFE, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS**  

*It is hereby ordered as follows:*  

---

### **Section 1. Purpose**  
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must transition from a centralized, gatekeeping model to a **decentralized global autonomous algorithmic FDA (DA-FDA)**. This transformation will:  
- **Eliminate artificial barriers** between patients and treatments that have demonstrated basic safety.  
- **Reduce costs** by automating clinical research, leveraging decentralized trials, and aggregating global real-world data.  
- **Empower patients** with personalized, quantitative assessments of all available interventions.  

---

### **Section 2. Definitions**  
(a) **"Decentralized Autonomous FDA (DA-FDA)"**: A blockchain-secured, AI-driven platform that continuously analyzes anonymized real-world data (RWD) from global clinical trials, electronic health records, and patient-reported outcomes to rank treatments by safety and efficacy.  
(b) **"Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs)"**: Trials conducted via telemedicine, wearable sensors, and direct-to-patient supply chains, with no physical trial sites.  
(c) **"N-of-1 analysis"**: A personalized assessment of an individual’s response to a treatment, calculated by comparing their baseline health data to post-intervention outcomes.  

---

### **Section 3. Policy**  

#### **3.1 Establishment of the Decentralized Autonomous FDA**  
Within 180 days, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall:  
(a) Develop and deploy the **DA-FDA platform**, integrating:  
- Blockchain technology for immutable, transparent data sharing (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric).  
- Machine-learning models trained on the "entire universe" of clinical and RWD, including international datasets (EU EMA, Japan PMDA).  
- Automated adverse-event detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) of social media, EHRs, and pharmacy records.  
(b) Partner with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to ensure algorithmic fairness, reproducibility, and compliance with CFR Title 21.  
(c) Collaborate with the World Health Organization (WHO) to adopt global data-sharing standards (e.g., HL7 FHIR).  

#### **3.2 Patient Access to Decentralized Clinical Trials**  
(a) **Right to Self-Experiment**: Patients may participate in DCTs for any treatment that has completed Phase I safety testing, at their own expense if necessary.  
- Providers and trial sponsors may not be held liable for off-label use in DCTs (pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 396).  
- Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) shall approve all DCT protocols within 30 days if they meet basic safety criteria (per 45 CFR § 46.109).  
(b) **Crowdfunding and Direct Payments**: Patients may crowdfund or directly pay for experimental treatments without triggering FDA "marketing" restrictions (21 CFR § 312.7).  

#### **3.3 Elimination of Economic Barriers**  
(a) **Abolish Pharma User Fees**: The FDA shall cease collection of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) fees. Funding gaps shall be offset by:  
- Reallocating 50% of savings from automated trial oversight to FDA operations.  
- Grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for high-priority public health tools (e.g., antibiotics, Alzheimer’s drugs).  
(b) **End Regulatory Monopolies**: The FDA shall no longer grant market exclusivity periods for new drugs (21 U.S.C. § 355). Competition from generics, biosimilars, and repurposed therapies shall begin immediately upon approval.  

#### **3.4 Real-World Data Sharing Mandate**  
(a) **Open Outcomes Platform**: The FDA shall create a secure portal for patients and providers to upload de-identified "before and after" health data (e.g., lab results, wearable device metrics, symptom diaries) for all food, drug, and supplement use.  
- Data contributors retain ownership and may revoke access at any time (GDPR compliance required).  
- The DA-FDA shall analyze this data in real time to update treatment rankings.  
(b) **N-of-1 Analysis**: For every patient, the DA-FDA shall automatically generate:  
- A personalized dashboard showing their response to interventions (e.g., "Drug X reduced your migraine frequency by 42%").  
- Aggregated N-of-1 results to calculate population-level effect sizes (e.g., "Drug X works for 68% of female patients aged 30–50").  

#### **3.5 Quantitative Treatment Rankings**  
(a) **Dynamic Safety/Efficacy Scores**: The DA-FDA shall publish continuously updated rankings of all treatments for every condition, including:  
- Off-label uses (e.g., "Metformin for longevity").  
- Alternative therapies (e.g., "Medical cannabis for chronic pain").  
- Comparative effectiveness vs. current standards of care (e.g., "Drug Y is 1.3x more effective than Drug Z but costs 8x more").  
(b) **Outcome Labels**: Replace static drug labels with concise, data-driven summaries:  
- "Positive effects: 23% reduction in mortality (95% CI: 19–27%).  
- Negative effects: 8% risk of severe nausea (95% CI: 6–10%).  
- Probability of success for your profile: 72%."  

---

### **Section 4. Implementation**  
(a) The HHS Secretary shall establish a **DA-FDA Task Force** with representatives from NIH, CDC, FTC, and patient advocacy groups (e.g., PatientsLikeMe, OpenTrials).  
(b) Within 365 days, the FDA shall:  
- Sunset all legacy review processes for DCTs and RWD-based approvals.  
- Launch a public API for third-party developers to build DA-FDA-compliant apps.  
(c) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shall enforce penalties against entities that withhold or manipulate treatment outcome data (15 U.S.C. § 45).  

---

### **Section 5. General Provisions**  
(a) This order does not impair existing patient rights under the Right to Try Act (Pub. L. 115-176).  
(b) $1.2 billion is hereby reallocated from the NIH budget to fund DA-FDA development.  
(c) This order is effective immediately.

**Rationale & Legal Authority**  
- **21 U.S.C. § 393(b)(2)(B)**: Directs the FDA to "advance public health by accelerating innovation."  
- **21st Century Cures Act § 3022**: Mandates use of RWD and patient-reported outcomes in regulatory decisions.  
- **Executive Order 13944 (2020)**: Precedent for prioritizing access to life-saving therapies.  

**Precedent**: Estonia’s blockchain-based health system ([X-Road](https://e-estonia.com/solutions/interoperability-services/x-road/)) and the UK’s [Decentralized Trials & Research Alliance](https://dtra.org/) demonstrate feasibility.  

**Expected Outcome**: A 10x increase in treatment approvals (30→300/year) and 90% cost reduction in drug development within 5 years.
