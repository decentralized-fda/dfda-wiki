<h1>Marketing Strategies</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automatically Generate Millions of Study Posts </strong>for each cause and effect of a pair of variables, showing the relationship between them. This will lead to a massive number of organic search results.</li>
  <li><strong>Shareable Infographics</strong> highlighting new discoveries are extremely well-positioned for high viral velocity.</li>
  <li><strong>Group Studies</strong> allow users to invite friends, family, or the public to pool their data.</li>
  <li><strong>Influencers </strong>such as self-help gurus would be able to use the Research Platform to recruit participants in crowdsourced studies to quantify the effectiveness of different strategies and techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Crowdfunding </strong>– donors can have their own quantified-self sites hosted by us to display their content and do studies on their focus of interest.</li>
  <li><strong>Academic Research Studies </strong>would provide academic researchers, citizen scientists, disease advocacy organizations, and influencers such as self-help gurus and bloggers a platform for human behavioral and clinical data.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide a Market for Quantified Self Apps – supply</strong> an Application Programming Interface (API) that is easy to use and conforms to established industry guidelines for information and security, as well as supply app templates for users to use in building applications,</li>
</ul>
