<h1>Neuroinflammation</h1>
<p>Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory response within the brain or spinal cord.</p>
<h2>Depression</h2>
<p>Depressed patients present increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and neuroinflammatory alterations.</p>
<p>Male rats received amitriptyline (AMI) a tricyclic, S-citalopram (ESC) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP) a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, vortioxetine (VORT) a multimodal AD or saline for ten days.</p>
<p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032719326539">induces</a> despair-like, impaired motivation/self-care behavior, and caused <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Anhedonia">anhedonia</a>.</p>
<p>All ADs prevented LPS-induced despair-like behavior.</p>
<p>Only VORT rescued impaired self-care behavior.</p>
<p>All ADs prevented LPS-induced increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6] and T-helper 1 cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interferon-Î³].</p>
<p>VORT increased striatal and hypothalamic IL-4 levels.</p>
<p>All ADs prevented LPS-induced neuroendocrine alterations, represented by increased levels of hypothalamic nitrite and plasma corticosterone response.</p>
<p>VORT and ESC prevented LPS-induced increase in NF-kBp65 hippocampal expression.</p>
<p>ESC, TCP, and VORT, but not IMI, prevented the alterations in phospho-CREB expression.</p>
<h2>MAOIs</h2>
<p>Inflammation is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are expressed by immune and non-immune cells. Their dysregulation is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Significant evidence supports that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. MAO inhibitors are principally prescribed for the management of a variety of central nervous system (CNS)-associated diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's; however, they also have anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS and a variety of non-CNS tissues. To bolster support for their development as anti-inflammatories, it is critical to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action.</p>
<p>MAO inhibitors decrease the generation of end products such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hydrogen peroxide</li>
  <li>aldehyde</li>
  <li>ammonium</li>
</ul>
<p>They also inhibit biogenic amine degradation, and this increases cellular and pericellular catecholamines in a variety of immune and some non-immune cells. This decrease in end product metabolites and increase in catecholamines can play a significant role in the anti-inflammatory effects of MAO inhibitors.</p>
<p>Irreversible and reversible <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/MAO_A">MAO-A</a>, <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/MAO_B">MAO-B</a>, and MAO-A/B inhibitors have all been shown to significantly reduce inflammation-associated cytokine and chemokine gene and protein expression in a variety of cell cultures and animal studies.&nbsp;</p>
