<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer's Project provides comfort, support, and assistance to persons with memory disorders and their caregivers across the Big Bend area.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Project is a non-profit organization funded by grants and private donations, and many of the services are delivered through volunteers. Our Day Respite Program and other support services help caregivers stay physically and emotionally healthy. We also deliver professional knowledge through seminars, training classes and peer support groups.</p>
<p>One of our main goals is to help caregivers sustain a healthy quality of life as they care for their loved one and to provide a comfortable, dignified, quality of life for people living with dementia. &nbsp;In many cases, our support helps delay the institutionalization of those living with the disease.&nbsp; Services are provided free of charge, donations for services are encouraged.</p>
