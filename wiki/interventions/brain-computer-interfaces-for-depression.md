There are several promising projects and technologies focused on using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for reducing depression.

1. UCSF Health's Depression Circuit Mapping: UCSF Health physicians have successfully treated a patient with severe depression by tapping into the specific brain circuit involved in depressive brain patterns and resetting them using a brain stimulation technique similar to a pacemaker for the brain [1](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/09/421541/treating-severe-depression-demand-brain-stimulation). This approach involves mapping a patient's depression circuit and characterizing their neural biomarker to develop a personalized treatment strategy.

2. Inner Cosmos BCI Implant: Inner Cosmos, a neurotechnology company, has developed a neural implant to treat depression[2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2023/01/10/inner-cosmos-raises-10-million-to-treat-depression-with-bci-implant/). The implant is designed to regulate mood by monitoring brain activity and providing targeted stimulation to specific brain regions involved in mood control[3](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11624921/First-implant-treat-depression-REVEALED-New-brain-chip-set-rival-Elon-Musks-Nueralink.html).

3. Brain-Machine Interfaces for Mood Regulation: Researchers at the University of Southern California are working on brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that translate brain signals into emotion and mood states [4](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/brain-machine-interfaces-may-used-study-regulate-mood/). They aim to use machine learning to understand brain signals associated with specific mood states and develop devices that can monitor and automatically apply stimulation to treat abnormal mood states.

4. Augmented Reality Brain-Computer Interface for Depression Prevention: A project called CREAM Depression, developed by Dr. Mary Woody at the University of Pittsburgh, uses an augmented reality headset and a brain-computer interface to help redirect attention away from depressive information and towards activities of daily living [5](https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/augmented-reality-brain-computer-interface-depression-prevention-receives-pitt-innovation-0). This approach aims to prevent depression by addressing the negativity bias in teens and their parents.

5. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): TMS is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression [6](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/about/pac-20384625). It is typically used when other depression treatments have not been effective. A recent study conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine found that a new type of magnetic brain stimulation, called SAINT, brought rapid remission to almost 80% of participants with severe depression [7](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/10/depression-treatment.html).

These projects and technologies demonstrate the potential of BCIs and related brain stimulation techniques in treating depression and regulating mood. As research in this field progresses, it is likely that more innovative approaches will emerge to help individuals suffering from depression and mood disorders.
