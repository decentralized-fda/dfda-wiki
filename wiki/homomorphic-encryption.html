<p>Homomorphic encryption&nbsp;is a form of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">encryption</a>&nbsp;that permits users to perform computations on encrypted data without first decrypting it. These resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, results in an identical output to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage">storage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">computation</a>. This allows data to be encrypted and outsourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while encrypted.</p>
