  <li>Federated learning&nbsp;(also known as&nbsp;collaborative learning) is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>&nbsp;technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">servers</a>&nbsp;holding local&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data samples</a>, without exchanging them. This approach stands in contrast to traditional centralized machine learning techniques where all the local datasets are uploaded to one&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">server</a>, as well as to more classical decentralized approaches which often assume that local data samples are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">identically distributed</a>.</li>
