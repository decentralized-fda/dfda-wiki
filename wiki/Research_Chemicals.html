<h1>Research Chemicals</h1>
<p>Research chemicals are fundamental in the development of novel pharmacotherapies. The common medical laboratory uses include <i>in vivo</i> and animal testing to determine therapeutic value, toxicology testing by contract research organizations to determine drug safety, and analysis by drug test and forensic toxicology labs for the purposes of evaluating human exposure. Many pharmacologically active chemicals are sold online under the guise of "research chemicals," when in reality they are untested designer drugs that are being sold for recreational use despite the compounds' transitional or unclear legal status.</p>
