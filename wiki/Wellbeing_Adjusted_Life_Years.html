<h1>Wellbeing Adjusted Life Years</h1>
<p>Health-adjusted life years (HALYs) are commonly used in public health to quantify the burden of a disease and compare the cost-effectiveness of different health interventions.</p>
<p>HALYs are a combined measure of morbidity and mortality. Mortality is measured by the number of years a person died before expected (Years of Life Lost). Morbidity is measured by the number of years a person lives with a specific disability, weighted by its severity (Years of Life Lived with Disability).</p>
<p>Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are the most common forms of HALYs, with the two most important differences being (i) DALYs express a loss, while QALYs express a gain and (ii) different weightings are applied to different disabilities.</p>
<p>HALYs may be age-weighted (where a year of life lived at the age of 20 is weighted higher than a year of life lived at age one) or discounted (where a year of life lived in five years is weighed less than a year of life lived now).</p>
<p>HALYs are useful for making health prioritization decisions, since they allow a common metric for comparison, but are intended only as a proxy measure of <i>health</i> outcomes. They are, therefore, of limited use in evaluating interventions that might result in higher (non-health-related) quality of life.</p>
<p>Research is underway to extend the HALY concept to encompass a broader measure of wellbeing. A wellbeing-adjusted life year sometimes referred to as a WELBY (Davison 2015) would weigh the value of different states based on a proxy of their overall impact on a composite measure of welfare, rather than just health. There is not yet a standard weighting of the welfare impact of different states, but advances in the research of subjective wellbeing may change this in the future.</p>
