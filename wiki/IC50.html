<h1>IC50</h1>
<p>The <strong>half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>)</strong> is a measure of the potency of a substance in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function.</p>
<p>IC<sub>50</sub> is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance (e.g. drug) is needed to inhibit, <i>in vitro</i>, a given biological process or biological component by 50%. The biological component could be an enzyme, cell, cell receptor, or microorganism. IC<sub>50</sub> values are typically expressed as molar concentration.</p>
<p>The IC50 value is inversely proportional to its strength. The higher the IC50 value, the smaller the strength of the drug, and vice versa.</p>
