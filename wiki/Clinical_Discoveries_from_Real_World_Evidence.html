<h1>Clinical Discoveries from Real World Evidence</h1>
<h2>Deep learning framework for drug repurposing via emulating clinical trials using real-world patient data</h2>
<p>There's evidence that the analysis of aggregate observational data can produce tremendous value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By analyzing insurance claims from over 100 million people, this recurrent neural network (RNN) discovered that at least 6 drugs were effective at treating coronary artery disease:</p>
