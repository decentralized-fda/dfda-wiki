<h1>L-Tyrosine</h1>
<p>Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning that it can either be obtained through your diet or can be naturally synthesized in your body as it is needed.</p>

<h2>N-acetyl L-tyrosine</h2>
<p>N-acetyl L-tyrosine is a synthetically altered form of tyrosine that contains acetic acid, which increases tyrosine's bioavailability and absorption into your bloodstream. Because of the increased bioavailability of acetic acid, N-acetyl L-tyrosine is the most common form of supplemental tyrosine.</p>
<h2>Sleep Aid</h2>
<p>N-acetyl L-tyrosine can be used as an effective sleep aid, according to the book, "Essentials of Sports Nutrition and Supplements." Tyrosine is needed for the synthesis of brain chemicals, such as serotonin. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter that is sometimes called the "happiness hormone" and can increase your mood and help you sleep at night. Taking 500 mg of N-acetyl L-tyrosine before bed may help you fall asleep faster and provide a deeper, more restful sleep.</p>
<h2>MAOI Interactions</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A comprehensive literature search of Google Scholar and PubMed revealed no reported cases of hypertensive crisis associated with concomitant administration of L-tyrosine and phenelzine. Review of current US Food and Drug Administration nutritional guidelines relating to ongoing phenelzine studies reveals no mention and requires no consideration of L-tyrosine ingestion in combination with phenelzine. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264502009_Administration_of_supplemental_L-tyrosine_with_phenelzine_A_clinical_literature_review">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264502009_Administration_of_supplemental_L-tyrosine_with_phenelzine_A_clinical_literature_review</a></p>
