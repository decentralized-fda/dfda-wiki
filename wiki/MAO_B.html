<h1>MAO-B</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/amine-oxidase-flavin-containing-isoenzyme-b">Monoamine oxidase-B</a> (MAO-B) is a FAD-dependent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/mitochondrial-enzyme">mitochondrial enzyme</a>, which, together with its <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/isoenzyme">isoenzyme</a> MAO-A, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of structurally diverse amines Kalgutkar et al. (2001). MAO-B is involved in the metabolism of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/biogenic-amine">biogenic amines</a> as well as amine <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/xenobiotic-agent">xenobiotics</a> Cesura and Pletscher (1992). Substrates preferential for MAO-B include <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/phenethylamine">2-phenylethylamine</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/benzylamine">benzylamine</a>. Other substrates, e.g., dopamine and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tyramine">tyramine</a>, show similar K<sub>m</sub> values for MAO-B and MAO-A Tipton et al. (1987), Waldmeier (1987). Among the xenobiotic amines metabolized by MAO-B, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/dopamine-receptor-stimulating-agent">dopaminergic</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/1-2-3-6-tetrahydro-1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine">1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine</a> (MPTP) has received particular attention due to its properties to induce a syndrome closely resembling Parkinson's disease. In fact, MAO-B plays a major role in the transformation of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/1-2-3-6-tetrahydro-1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine">MPTP</a> into <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium">1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium</a> (MPP+), the species responsible for the neurotoxic effects Langston et al. (1983), Markey et al. (1984).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monoamine-oxidase-b-inhibitor">MAO-B inhibitor</a> L-deprenyl is in clinical use for the treatment of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/parkinson-disease">Parkinson's disease</a> and, currently, several MAO-B inhibitors are under clinical investigation in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
