<h2>Interactions</h2>
<h3>Bupropion (Wellbutrin)</h3>
<p>TCP has been combined or augmented successfully with other psychopharmaceuticals that do not activate serotonergic pathways, such as bupropion (<i>n</i>=2, <i>n</i>=1 and <i>n</i>=unknown, respectively) (Cole and Bodkin, 2002, Quante and Zeugmann, 2012, Pierre and Gitlin, 2000). Bupropion is contraindicated with TCP, but no examples of adverse reactions were found.</p>
<h3>DL-phenylalanine (DLPA), L-phenylalanine, and NALT</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I've tried both DL-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine, as well as NALT, but none of them seem particularly noticeable to me. Let me know if it does anything for you.- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/ilwzhu/d_l_phenylalanine_on_parnate/">https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/ilwzhu/d_l_phenylalanine_on_parnate/</a></p>

<h3>5-HTP</h3>
<h4><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></h4>
<p>The combination of tryptophan or&nbsp;<i>5</i>-<i>HTP</i> <i>or Tryptophan</i>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors_MAOIs"><i>MAOIs</i></a>&nbsp;can cause serotonin syndrome/neurotoxicity.</p>
<p><strong>5-HTP</strong> is commonly used to augment antidepressants including MAOIs by increasing serotonin production. These drugs should only be used under the supervision of a medical provider. Read a guide on 5-HTP augmentation&nbsp;<a href="https://maoinhibitors.com/augmenting-mao-inhibitors/"><i><strong>here</strong></i></a> or learn about a case of serotonin syndrome <a href="https://maoinhibitors.com/l-tryptophan-serotonin-syndrome/"><i><strong>here</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>

<h4><a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Relative_Nutritional_Deficiency">Relative Nutritional Deficiency</a></h4>
<p>When taken on its own, 5-HTP can deplete dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels. Consequently, you increase your risk of developing depression and high stress levels.</p>
<p>That's because serotonin synthesis from 5-HTP, and dopamine from L-dopa, are catalyzed by the same enzyme, L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD).</p>
<p>When you don't take these precursors in balanced amounts, 5-HTP conversion dominates dopamine at the enzyme levels. This competitive inhibition can lead to a deficiency of dopamine, as well as a lack of the other catecholamines. And when dopamine levels are insufficient, 5-HTP will no longer function. So Tryptophan may be more effective as a long-term augmentation for sleep and well-being.</p>
<p>Administration of 5-HTP alone is contraindicated for depression and any process involving a catecholamine component due to its ability to facilitate the depletion of these neurotransmitters. 5-HTP should be administered carefully in patients because depletion of dopamine and norepinephrine may exacerbate existing disease processes or precipitate the onset of catecholamine-related problems.</p>
<p>Administering serotonin or dopamine amino acid precursors should never involve the administration of only one amino acid. Improperly balanced amino acid precursors are associated with decreased efficacy, increased side effects, and depletion of the nondominant system.</p>

<h3>L-Tryptophan</h3>
<h4><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The combination of </strong><i><strong>Tryptophan</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>MAOIs</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;can cause serotonin syndrome/neurotoxicity.</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Tryptophan</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is commonly used to augment antidepressants including MAOIs by increasing serotonin production.

<p><a href="https://maoinhibitors.com/serious-risks/">https://maoinhibitors.com/serious-risks/</a> Some cautionary comments near the bottom of this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/d8bqwd/how_i_defeated_parnate_poop_out/">L-tryptophan augmentation experience report</a> should probably be at the top:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But tryptophan is not something to be taken lightly. Those case studies you cited and the clinical trials I cited used crazy amounts of tryptophan on top of MAOIs and amitriptyline... Like 7-8g a day! My maintenance dose is 1g three times daily. I titrated up to that point and I gave myself serotonin toxicity several times along the way by increasing the dose too quickly or spacing them too closely.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do not under any circumstances recommend PEA supplementation to Parnate (or Nardil) users. I gather that you might have meant via supplementation with Phenylalanine you can boost PEA, but it's not clear and someone could get hurt or worse.</p>
  <p>PEA is often dosed upwards of 250mg (without MAOIs) but with Parnate/Nardil worrying sympathomimetic/cardiovascular effects from PEA can be noted at a mere 20mg. I'd be surprised if 250mg is survivable without medical intervention...</p>
  <p>I learned a very scary lesson with <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Phenylethylamine_PEA">PEA</a>. I thought my heart was going to explode and the only thing i could do was pace up and down until it stopped. That was about 20mg on a dose of 45mg of Nardil. - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/d8bqwd/how_i_defeated_parnate_poop_out/">Reddit experience report</a></p>

<h4>Hypertensive Crisis</h4>
<p>A comprehensive literature search of Google Scholar and PubMed revealed no reported cases of hypertensive crisis associated with concomitant administration of L-tyrosine and phenelzine. A review of current US Food and Drug Administration nutritional guidelines relating to ongoing phenelzine studies reveals no mention and requires no consideration of L-tyrosine ingestion in combination with phenelzine. - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112771/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112771/</a></p>
<h5>Case Report</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Patient tolerated co-administration of <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Relative_Nutritional_Deficiency">L-Tyrosine</a> 1,500 mg with a Selegiline dose equivalent to 60 mg via oral administration without noticeable side effects but failed to obtain augmented antidepressant effects.</p>
  <p>While Selegiline is selective for MAO-B at low doses and thus a tyramine-restricted diet may not be needed, at the patient's Selegiline dose, its activity was non-selective and thus a tyramine-restricted diet must be observed. [2] However, the impact of tyramine on <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a> may be reduced due to the fact that sublingual Selegiline avoids first-pass metabolism through the gut and thereby may reduce the amount of gut MAO that is inhibited and unable to break down tyramine. [3]</p>
  <p><strong>Background</strong><br>L-Tyrosine is converted to both L-DOPA, a precursor of dopamine, and tyramine. [4] Given tyramine consumption is contraindicated with MAO inhibitor use as it may cause a <strong>hypertensive crisis</strong>, reasonable concern, albeit theoretical, remains over the safety of L-Tyrosine supplementation in MAO inhibitor use. [5] However, L-Tyrosine is found in significant qualities in a wide variety of foods, [6] and to our knowledge has not been reported to be associated with increased <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a> when consumed as food or as a supplement. Evidence in support of L-Tyrosine role's in treating depression remains scarce. While low tyrosine levels have been reported to correlate with increased symptoms of depression, [7, 8] these findings have not been reproduced in other studies. [9-12] Only one study to our knowledge discusses L-Tyrosine augmentation for MAO inhibitors and has been redacted due to undisclosed conflicts of interest. Furthermore, while L-Tyrosine has been found to be associated with improvements in depression, [13, 14] other studies have failed to prove an association between L-Tyrosine and improvement in symptoms of depression. [15, 16]</p>
  <p><strong>Case</strong><br>A patient on 7.5 mg sublingual Selegiline, equivalent to 60 mg of oral Selegiline, [17] desired augmentation with l-tyrosine. His provider advised against supplementation given the lack of data supporting its efficacy and due to the fact that there was no established safe dose for L-Tyrosine supplementation in patients on MAO inhibitors. However, the patient still desired L-Tyrosine supplementation and was advised to take a starting dose of 125 mg, far lower than the quantities found in many common, non-contraindicated foods, [6] out of an abundance of caution given the lack of studies evaluating this combination treatment. The patient obtained L-Tyrosine tablets from a well-known company that produces a wide array of supplements. Other ingredients included: Lysine, Cellulose Gel, Stearic Acid, Silicon Dioxide, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Magnesium Stearate, Polyethylene Glycol. The patient was instructed to monitor <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a> over 4 hours, despite the typical rise in <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a> for only 90-120 minutes following tyramine consumption. This extended period of monitoring was due to the limited data exploring the rate at which L-Tyrosine is converted to tyramine. Patient was escalated to 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, 1000 mg, 1250 mg, and 1500 mg on sequential days after reporting no side effects from the previous day. Despite the fact that studies discussed above used higher doses, attempts to go higher than 1,500 were abandoned as patient no longer desired to try higher doses of L-Tyrosine.</p>

<h3>Memantine</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dr-bob.org/babble/20110902/msgs/996139.html">https://www.dr-bob.org/babble/20110902/msgs/996139.html</a></p>
<p>Long-term NMDAR antagonism correlates reduced astrocytic glutamate uptake with anxiety-like phenotype</p>
<p>"Our results demonstrated that long-term administration of memantine induces anxiety-like behavior in mice in the light-dark box and elevated plus-maze paradigms. Additionally, the administration of memantine decreased glutamate uptake activity in both the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus without altering the immunocontent of either GLT-1 or GLAST. Remarkably, the memantine-induced reduction in glutamate uptake was correlated with enhancement of an anxiety-like phenotype. In conclusion, long-term NMDAR antagonism with memantine induces anxiety-like behavior that is associated with reduced glutamate uptake activity but that is not dependent on GLT-1 or GLAST protein expression."</p>
<h3>Nortriptyline</h3>
<p>I tried 20mgs Nortriptyline this after. SOMETHING happened "right away" as in, a couple of hours. I went from flat and zoney and somewhat humorless to engaged, happy, and a bit more racy in the brain. It seemed like a holiday from the Parnate: I was talking with my clients, maybe even too much. It was a little tough to stay grounded in my work (massage therapist) and I was digging facebook and thinking about the weekend. Again, maybe too much. My throat got super tight, which for me is the worst part of physical anxiety.</p>

<h3>NSI-189</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hello friend. I can relate what you're describing, have personally fought with both crippling anxiety and depression for years and what I think is quite deep or heavy damage from childhood and past traumas. I believe you did have a good hunch about trying the Parnate, and maybe NSI-189 too, although let me give a suggestion.</p>
  <p>In your current state I don't recommend you start with the NSI-189 at the same time as Tranylcypromine. Because NSI tends to re activate precisely everything related to feelings and emotions, bounded to memories, both neurochemical as well as psychological and I may add spiritual too. This is something good for actually healing, but such powerful restoring and reconnecting effects and processes can truly be overwhelming if your struggling now with severe (or considerable) anxiety and depression, more if those symptoms have a deep relation with childhood or general traumatic experiences and any form of aggression. It can also make one prone to neuroticism and anxiety, using the words of the author of the post "Nardil, NSI-189, and Methylphenidate".</p>
  <p>The NSI-189 seems for many to be a very valuable substance, and (apparently) with few serious risks (which may be greater, psychoneurologically, if used in states as the one you may be now), and I think it can help you indeed, but first you need to address the more severe symptoms. In that case, TCP is a great option. If effective for you, which is very probable, you will begin to note after few weeks (although for some take some days and for some some months, but usually you'll see some result early) how anxiety starts diminishing, day to day, you don't even notice when there's already a big difference; also the mind will be more serene and not get stuck in so much shit and on each single negative thought-emotion, past or future issues. You'll notice how it is much easier to go out and socialize, talk to people without feeling awkward or wanting to be in your shell all the time. Depression will start to lift and you'll notice how life begins to not suck, how not everything seems so fucking heavy and dives you down, how you react much calmer to stressful situations-triggers-thoughts-feelings-emotions. And slowly you'll start to see more motivation, gratefulness, and the full effects can take some months, so you'll have to be patient, but you will start noticing the positive effects I describe soon.</p>
  <p>Parnate can even make you feel a little emotionally numb or indifferent at first or at certain dosage (which may be too low or to high, you need to do a good titration, which can be more aggressive if you are really desperate, but not so much you mess with the effectiveness of the med, or get intolerable side effects; here you should read the guidelines in Dr. Gillman's site, start and keep measuring your <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a>, as orthostatic drops are a way to know response and if effective dose has been reached and you can ask me of course if you feel like it, and there are many here that are very knowledgeable), and at moments you start even not caring at all if something sad or embarrassing happens to you, but don't worry, first, it does not promote <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Anhedonia">anhedonia</a>, you will enjoy things much more than in your current situation, value human relations, simple things, food etc... second, this is the first part, and you'll be grateful of feeling good, better than in years maybe, even if your a little emotionally numb (as I tell you, not anhedonic, you will feel happy! even too happy sometimes; it is not at all like with SSRIs), and third, we can address that later. It could also be good if you do find a good psychiatrist-neuropsychopharmacology's, good ol' learned and open minded one, avoid mediocre or the stereotypical today's "progressive" psychs which have very partial knowledge, shallow clinical practice and not knowledge at all of (if not aversion to) MAOIs.</p>
  <p>I do (and many) believe, based on experience and study, that MAOIS can indeed rewire the brain, but they take their time, also don't expect to be exactly as a psychedelic would be (more like NSI-189), but don't need to worry, you can later start some authentic psychedelic-entheogen therapy, which are wonderful, as psychedelics are the most amazing, beautiful and integral substances-plants, but in your current state, and for what I can sense you need to treat first the acute and most terrible-intense symptoms of anxiety, depression, depersonalization and start working with your traumas, getting some good psychotherapy for enhancing also that rewiring and regeneration-restructuring of the mind and brain, as soon as you start feeling better with the TCP. Also (and more if you value psychedelic experience) you can benefit a lot from daily meditation, if it's too difficult now, try to start with 5, then 10 minutes, then 15, 20, and so on, but even if you meditate for 5 minutes, don't miss a day. There are different meditation techniques, I can recommend you shamatha for the moment, constant body scans, breathing meditation in general and mindfulness, and also yoga nidra, and if you do have a particular spiritual practice, engage more into it, little by little, as you begin feeling better and better (if not a practice, try just to hold into your spirituality). Psychophysical exercise sciences and arts as qi gong, tai ji chuan or hatha yoga are amazing tools too and will help you feel better physically, mentally and spiritually.</p>
  <p>After you achieve good progress with Parnate and psychotherapy, meditation, etc., and you feel much more in control of your emotions, no despersonalized, without that awful anxiety, depression, guilt, feelings of inadequacy, etc... like real, robust positive changes, after some months-a year or so, then I think it would be a good moment to start NSI-189, as the specific neurogenesis it promotes (Parnate promotes neurogenesis too, but not of the same kind) in the hippocampus-derived neural stem cell, that will act on the parts responsible for learning, memory, and emotion directly, along with different processes, will be now much better directed upon the positive, now that you have stabilized the crippling anxiety and the depression, oversensibity... and the long-term changes and restructuring it can promote, will be of course of a positive nature in general. With NSI you can feel much more sensitive and even vulnerable to emotions and memories both good and nice, as painful and traumatic ones, so that's why I commented you should not start with this one first, and less if you start such a powerful antidepressant as Tranylcypromine; but with all the positive potentiation of neurotransmitters, brain chemistry-functions, psychologic stability and general well being and resilience that will allow you TCP, then you will be in an optimal state for NSI 189 treatment, and it will help you further with the anhedonia, as well as depersonalization and related shit.</p>
  <p>About psychedelics, the one that have helped me the most is the sacred medicine Ayahuasca (with which I reached for the only time in my life complete remission), in ritual-very specific healing directed contexts and with true specialists, but first you need to come off any antidepressant, but you can contemplate it in the future (also is really a serious thing, you need to do diet and stop alcohol, weed, masturbation, etc., if you want to get true results). With MAOIs you should be able to use some psychedelics after stabilized (regular tryptamines as LSD, psilocyn-psilocybin, and even mescaline, which is noradrenergic and a phenethylamine (but not cacti, as they have hordenine, tyramine and other noradrenergic releasers), but not 2cxxs, NBOM or related ones, AMT, MDMA, etc., those can be really dangerous with MAOIs, so one needs to be very careful with what is taking) but sensitivity will be pretty much reduced because the overflowing of catecholamines in the receptors... but you could try a protocol like this, while tapering down the <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors_MAOIs">MAOI</a> to a low dosage, you can start with micro doses of psilocybin, for example, slow and little by little, and then go into full entheogenic doses once you are off the MAOI (you should value if it is worth it, sometimes it is best to wait longer with a treatment so powerful and life changing as can be a MAOI if it really is making a positive difference in your life, no need to rush, and although healing, psychedelics can be anxiogenic for some people, just be wise and safe).</p>
  <p>I'm just commenting you this because psychedelics are great medicines and you seem interested, but don't rush, the best recommendation would be, start with the Parnate, it is truly an incredible medicine, like no other, titrate your dose up adequately, get the full therapeutic effects take it for a year or 2, whatever you need and is best for you (again, one be wise and smart in these regards) and then, if you think you can benefit and you want, you can try with psychedelic therapy. For the NSI you can start before and while in the TCP treatment (anyway, being extra careful, start low go slow, there are not studies on these combinations, studying the situation, and according to testimonials, there doesn't seem to be a problem or harmful interaction, within therapeutic doses range, but this is still in part <i>Tierra Ignota).</i></p>
  <p>But really, please take into account what I mentioned, and wait until you're really mentally-emotionally stable and feeling stable on the TCP, at least maybe 7-months, but could be more, or less, depending on you.</p>
  <p>I hope you start getting better soon, I'm positive you will. My best wishes.</p>

<h3>Paradoxical hypertension</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is invaluable to have an ongoing record of <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a> as described above. This is especially so when episodes of paradoxical hypertension occur, which is sometimes seen (in approximately 5% of cases, in my experience). This paradoxical hypertension (not related to tyramine ingestion) characteristically commences an hour or so after the second dose of the day, especially when the dose is a little higher, and lasts for a couple of hours or so before subsiding spontaneously. Although such episodes do cause concern in some people, especially doctors, they are rarely, if ever, sufficiently high to be problematic. In my experience, they rarely go over 180 to 200 mmHg, and then only briefly (see my comment on this here [8]). Again, this phenomenon often dwindles away over time. If treatment is thought to be advisable a beta-blocker like propranolol is appropriate, although it should be noted that propranolol is not suitable for severe hypertension secondary to tyramine ingestion.<a href="https://psychotropical.com/author/dr-ken-gillman/">Dr Ken Gillman</a></p>

  <p>Delving into the positive aspects for me, I have experienced an markedly increased tolerance for stress with things like work - when things get crazy at my job (phlebotomy) I am totally unfazed. I couldn't believe how strong this effect is as I am usually someone highly negatively affected mentally by stress. There is a noticeable stimulant effect, though mild, but unlike amphetamine or meth (in my opinion), there is a motivational push behind it. On day 2 I started working out and returned to eating vegan, meal prepping everyday. It's really allowing me to just push through life getting done what I need and want to do. It makes me feel as young, energetic and happy as I should for a 24 year old. The constant fatigue, lack of motivation and every other aspect of my depression and anxiety that has weighed me down for the last 10 years and really hindered my ability to move about the world in the way that I want has all lifted. The noticeable part of the stimulant effect, in the sense of a buzz, has gone away so there is some tolerance there I suppose, but I would still say it stimulates me in that I feel like I have a normal energy level that I can't remember having since being in my teens.</p>
  <p>The main side effect for me is insomnia, some nights are really hard to fall asleep. I have always struggled with this to an extent though so I don't know how much of it really is the Tranylcypromine. I do get occasional low diastolic <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a> which can make me feel a bit faint for a few seconds when I stand up, nothing like the severe orthostatic hypotension some speak of. Also I do experience a slight drop in my mood and energy (comparable to a caffeine crash in severity) in the afternoon if I take it all in the morning without a midday dose. I suspect this is due to the dopamine releasing effect wearing off throughout the day. All in all, side effects are pretty minimal and can be attenuated. The diet is also not as hard as it seems just looking at it. I still eat soy sauce, vegemite, protein powder, tempeh, miso soup, kimchi, sauerkraut, fake meats, all the beans and nuts I want, drink wine and kefir. Nothing has spiked my blood pressure. That being said everyone taking Tranylcypromine should exercise the caution with these foods as professionally advised. Everyone's tyramine sensitivity is different so people should experiment with tiny amounts first and monitor their blood pressure for the next 2 hours to see if there is a rise.</p>
  <p>All in all, it's been great for me. It's the only antidepressant that has really attenuated my symptoms to the degree that I can focus on real life self improvement. The demonisation of the drug is unwarranted in my opinion. It's really not as dangerous or difficult to use as people make it out to be. Sure, I can't take MDMA or other stimulants anymore, but that is probably for the better. I can still at least use LSD and nitrous which are and always have been my main substances of choice. I experience severe worrying headaches when I smoke any amount of any cannabis now (and did while on high dose Moclobemide too). They are not officially contraindicated substances and I don't get a blood pressure rise from doing so, so I'm not sure I'm in any real danger when I get stoned, but the pain and anxiety (it's sent me to ER 3 times) it triggers are not worth the high for me anymore. As far as I know this is pretty unique and I've never heard of people having trouble with cannabis and MAOIs before so don't be scared off if you are thinking about MAOI therapy people! I would recommend it to anyone with depression and anxiety that has found little relief on the usual medication merrygo-round of SSRIs, SNRIs, NRIs, TCAs, TeCAs, SARIs, SMSs and so on, especially if they have significant lethargic and amotivational features.</p>

<h2>Dosing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Starting with 20 mg and increasing to 30 mg after 10 days would be the most frequent pattern.</li>
  <li>However, if after 5 days on 30 mg, the blood pressure drop on standing was less than 10 mmHg, then I would probably proceed to 40 mg, but then allow a full 14 days on 40 mg to judge the effect.</li>
  <li>If the BP drop on 30 mg was more than 15 mmHg then I would wait the full 10-14 days to assess the maximal degree of postural hypotension at that dose.</li>
  <li>If that level of postural hypotension was still present at 14 days I would wait a full 4 weeks on that dose to assess the degree of illness improvement.</li>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<h3>MAO inhibition</h3>
<p>TCP deactivates both MAO isoforms <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/MAO_A">MAO-A</a> and <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/MAO_B">MAO-B</a> with 76 nM (MAO-A) and 90 nM (MAO-B) needed to reduce by 50% (aka <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/IC50">IC50</a>) in rat brain homogenates (Coutts et al., 1987).</p>

<p>In a study of chronic TCP at doses of 1.28 mg/kg/day, rat brain MAO inhibition further increased from <strong>86% after the first day</strong> to approximately <strong>95% after four weeks</strong> (Hampson et al., 1988). In humans taking a <strong>single dose of 10 mg</strong> TCP, mean platelet MAO-B inhibition reached <strong>66% after 3 h</strong> (range 53% to 83%) and <strong>72% after 24 h</strong> (range 57% to 87%) (Simpson et al., 1985).</p>
<p>A single dose of <strong>20 mg</strong> TCP induced <strong>85% inhibition after 24 h</strong> (Fritz et al., 1983).</p>
<p>Mean brain MAO-A inhibition was <strong>58%</strong> in four healthy volunteers treated with <strong>10 mg/day TCP for three days</strong> (Fowler et al., 1996).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X17302523">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X17302523</a></p>
<h3>Receptor Changes</h3>
<p>Chronic application for 21-28 days of low to medium doses of TCP (mainly 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, one study 5 mg/kg/day (Ordway et al., 1991)) in rats decreased the densities of</p>
<ul>
  <li>Î±2-adrenoceptors (Greenshaw et al., 1988)</li>
  <li>β1- and β2-adrenoceptors (Ordway et al., 1991, Paetsch and Greenshaw, 1993)</li>
  <li>5-hydroxytryptamine-(5-HT2, serotonin)-receptors (Goodnough and Baker, 1994)</li>
  <li>dopamine-D1- and D2-receptors (Paetsch and Greenshaw, 1992)</li>
</ul>
<p>in certain regions of the CNS.</p>
<p>This receptor down-regulation is likely a consequence of increased neurotransmitter concentration after acute TCP treatment and may also explain some aspects of the delayed therapeutic effect and tolerance to adverse effects.</p>
<h3>Neurogenesis</h3>
<p>According to the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression, chronic TCP application increased the expression of plasticity/growth-associated factors in the CNS, such as growth-associated protein-(GAP)-43 in rat cultured hippocampal cells with 2 mM TCP for 7 days (Chen et al., 2003). Chronic, but not acute, administration of TCP (10 mg/kg/day for 14 days) significantly increased second messenger cAMP-response-element-(CRE)-mediated gene transcription in mice, which is involved in the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Thome et al., 2000). BDNF itself was also increased with 5-10 mg/kg/day TCP for 14-21 days (Assareh et al., 2012, Khundakar and Zetterstroem, 2006, Torregrossa et al., 2005), including the aging brain (Garza et al., 2004), in ex-vivo experimental animal (rats) studies. BDNF increase by 7.5 mg/kg/day TCP in rats for 7 days was dependent on the uptake of peripheral insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) into the CNS (Chen and Russo-Neustadt, 2007). Therefore, the outgrowth of hippocampal dendrites in rat cultured hippocampal cells with 1.50 µM TCP for 10 days (Seo et al., 2014) and ex-vivo bromodeoxyuridine-(BrdU)-labeled neurogenesis in rats with 7.5-10 mg/kg/day TCP for 21 days (Malberg et al., 2000) were increased.</p>
<h3>Corticotropin Releasing Factor</h3>
<p>Depression is associated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF) via regulation of CRF (O'Brien S. M. et al., 2004). IL-1 and TNFÎ± stimulate the secretion of IL-6, which in turn exerts negative feedback regulation on the production of IL-1 and TNFÎ± (O'Brien S. M. et al., 2004). IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFÎ± stimulate the secretion of the Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) and results in hyperactivity of the HPA axis (Dentino et al., 1999; Kariagina et al., 2004).</p>
<p>A CRF1 antagonist (SSR125543) can block the effects of inflammatory cytokines on stress-related behaviors (Knapp et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Moreover, CRF can induce the release of TNF in glial cells (Wang et al., 2003). Another study demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of CRF increased the expression of TNF and IL-6 (Chen H. et al., 2018).</p>
<p>These results imply that during depression, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the secretion of CRF, and CRF activation may in turn facilitate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00290/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00290/full</a></p>
<p>1.5-2 mg/kg/day TCP in rats for 28 days also reduced stress-induced hypersecretion of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), which is in agreement with the hypothesis of hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depression (Stout et al., 2002). <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X17302523">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X17302523</a></p>
