<h1>LongeCity</h1>
<p>The LongeCity (Longecity.org/ImmInst.org) is an international, not-for-profit, membership-based organization</p>
<p>Our mission is "to conquer the blight of involuntary death". &nbsp;</p>
<p>To advance this mission, we aim to foster:</p>
<p><strong>An open public forum for information and discussion; </strong>The main hub is our forum which invites discussions of diverse topics: science, nutrition, lifestyle, and philosophy. Its features include messaging, subscriptions, ratings, keyword tags, and annotations. All visitors can read our forum subject to our user agreement. To contribute, everyone can register a free account, which also opens the door to a small but dedicated 'social network' for the life extension community. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A repository for relevant information;</strong> All information on LongeCity is sourced from the community. In addition to the forum, features include archives for videos, supplement regimens, links, pictures, articles, interviews, a community database of expert activists, and volunteers, and other information.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific research;</strong> LongeCity supports small but impactful research efforts at the community and student levels. We have supported a range of successful research projects, fundraisers, and student internships, and we have established a unique program with 'Affiliate Labs' led by young scientists who emerged from within our community.</p>
<p><strong>Community initiatives</strong>; LongeCity has taken the community-focused 'crowdsourcing' approach to a diverse range of projects. We are always interested in new ideas and support those who champion them. We also foster international connections and local meetings across the life extension scene.</p>

<h2><strong>Management, Members &amp; Partners &nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>LongeCity is a membership-based organization ("501-3-c status" in the United States) governed by a 'constitution'. Membership is open to all persons who apply. Members elect and deselect a Board of Directors from amongst their number. The Board appoints key officers and other stewards. Once a year we hold a member's consultation about activities and how to spend our limited funds and announce these plans and other news in our regular newsletter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>LongeCity maintains friendly relations with other organizations working toward the same mission. We are always open to suggestions for shared projects. This text explains how we collaborate with others. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Founding</strong></h2>
<p>The Immortality Institute was founded in 2002 by Bruce J. Klein as a development of his private website, and incorporated under Alabama law in 2003. The inaugural Directors were Bruce Klein, Susan Fonseca-Klein, Michael Anissimov, Kenneth X. Sills, Kevin Perrott, Caliban, and Reason.</p>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2>
<p>LongeCity is sustained by donations and by advertising. Adverts are often served via Google and are less visible to LongeCity Members. Other advertisers need to respect LongeCity's independence and impartiality. Membership donations underpin an annual lifetime membership. Discounts are available. One-time donations can also be made in support of particular <a href="https://www.longecity.org/forum/donate/">initiatives</a>.</p>
<h2>LongeCity Affiliate Labs</h2>
<p><strong>The Longecity 'Affiliate Labs'</strong> are small, research-focused enterprises or independent academic research groups led by a scientist with strong ties to the Longecity community and a proven track record of commitment to scientific inquiry directly relevant to the Longecity mission.</p>
<p>These leaders and their colleagues are not just trailblazers in advancing important areas of regenerative and rejuvenation research, but also incredibly helpful when there is a community need for peer review, when providing advice and training to a young scientist, and in providing the expertise and tools to test the novel, controversial, or promising scientific leads sourced from the Longecity community and beyond.</p>
<h3><strong>Community Funding</strong></h3>
<p>There is a small support fund that the labs can draw on to flexibly support their research activities. While not a substitute for private investment and public sector grants, the ability to flexibly “just try” out a new idea without needing to “pitch” in lengthy proposals can be an invaluable accelerator to research progress. All Affiliates have an active link to the Longecity community, so there is a level of accountability and responsiveness beyond anything encountered in “traditional” research donations.</p>
<p>By donating to the Affiliate Labs fund, Members can be assured that every penny goes directly to an expert personally and professionally committed to making a difference in the scientific conquest of death.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What are the most successful <a href="https://www.longecity.org/forum/donate/">initiatives</a> so far?</li>
  <li>Has anyone considered a wiki component in addition to the forum as a way to make the information in the forum comments more digestible? Example: <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/">https://psychonautwiki.org/</a></li>
  <li>Has there been any collaboration with government health agencies?</li>
  <li>What do you think about a focus on diseases associated with aging as opposed to longevity to take advantage of the human cognitive bias towards fear of negative threats exceeding desire for aspirational goods?</li>
  <li>Are there any efforts to coordinate group buys of investigational treatments and collect data on their positive and negative effects?</li>
  <li>What are some of the best surrogate measures for longevity that an individual could collect on an ongoing basis to evaluate as target outcomes in personal experiments?</li>
  <li>Is life extension inherently an intrinsic good in your mind, or is maximizing pleasure and minimizing suffering the goal?</li>
  <li>Can you tell me about Rejuvecat?</li>
