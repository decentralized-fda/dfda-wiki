<h2>Essentials</h2>
<h3>Bromantane (25-50 mg sublingual for 8-12 weeks)</h3>
<p>Equivalent to 50-200 mg orally, but with much faster pharmacokinetics (oral onset is 4 hours in men). Provides long-lasting up-regulation of TH and AAAD, which get heavily downregulated from chronic stimulant (ab)use. These are the key enzymes that lead to the natural biosynthesis of dopamine in the brain. This means that the rapid up-regulation/gene expression changes to TH and AAAD lead to a higher baseline production of natural dopamine on a semi-permanent basis. This is in stark contrast to traditional stimulants that just end up depleting neurotransmitters by monoamine release and/or reuptake inhibition, which subsequently decreases the natural production of dopamine due to the continuous down-regulation of TH and AAAD as a compensatory mechanism. It also possesses anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant properties, as well as greatly increased physical stamina as a bonus. The best source was the brand name Ladasten from CosmicNootropics (no longer in production) but currently Science.Bio is your best bet for <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Bromantane">Bromantane</a> powder. You can keep taking Bromantane indefinitely, but not in conjunction with amphetamine.</p>
<h3>Cerebrolysin + Cortexin (5mL + 5 mg intramuscularly daily for 6-8 weeks)</h3>
<p>The ultimate restorative peptide cocktail - stronger than <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/BPC_157">BPC-157</a>. Provides overall restoration, repair, and recovery of all systems. Both greatly increase neurotrophic factors, endorphins, and enkalphins, and increase neurosteroid production. They also promote neuronal and synaptic plasticity, increase neurogenesis, increase brain energy metabolism, and intracellular protein synthesis. They are both extremely neuroprotective, powerful antioxidants that are ripe with various amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. There are loads of pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects as well. They're basically Russian super-Nootropics, and absolutely worth the cost for the overall restorative effects after stimulant or any other drug abuse. It's very easy to inject IM daily as it's not an oil, simply dissolve 5mL Cerebrolysin per 5 mg Cortexin sterile vials. Cosmic Nootropics and NootropicSpot are both reputable Russian vendors. You can keep taking low doses of Cerebrolysin/Cortexin indefinitely, but the cost will likely prohibit you.</p>
<h3>BPC-157 (250-500mcg subcutaneously for 6-8 weeks)</h3>
<p>For overall restoration, healing, and repair of pretty much all neurotransmitter systems including dopamine (which is very pronounced), physical and bodily injuries/wounds of all kinds, gut/stomach issues such as IBS and gastritis, and much more. It seems to reset your hedonic tone and reward system from dopaminergic abuse, likely due to positive downstream changes on FosB and CREB which are the main transcription factors responsible for drug addiction, the former being dubbed the molecular switch between drug reward and cues. The most reputable source is Diagen who is the actual patent owner and only vendor to carry 'Stable' BPC-157, which you would need if you want to take it orally for greater emphasis on gut/intestinal issues. You can keep taking BPC-157 indefinitely.</p>
<h3><a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/9_Me_BC_(9_Methyl_carboline)">9-Me-BC</a> (10-20 mg orally for 6-8 weeks)</h3>
<p>For immediate tolerance reversal and interim replacement of amphetamine (as a medication holiday). Upregulates and differentiates dopaminergic neurons, dendrites, and synapses. Increases dopamine synthesis in addition to neurotrophins/neurotrophic factors like NGF, BDNF, CDNF, GDNF, etc. High doses are anxiogenic, convulsive, and even more, pro-cognitive/memory enhancing since it's a benzodiazepene receptor inverse agonist (hence a Nootropic). Higher doses past 30 mg can also be dangerous due to strong <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors_MAOIs">MAOI</a> effects (especially combined with stimulants), and due to possible neurotoxic by-products like 2-dime, BC that could result from a bad synthesis, which is just as neurotoxic as neurotoxin MPP+. The only reputable source is Science. Bio and they provide a full CoA with mass spectrometry. Most people use Predator Nutrition's in-house brand called Hydrapharm successfully and provide good anecdotes, but they don't provide a CoA when requested, so it would be prudent to not take more than one capsule (15 mg) though many take 2 capsules (30 mg) with no issue and reap even more positive effects. I think the risk is overstated, 9-MBC should be able to destroy that neurotoxin via its own neuroprotective mechanisms, and using BPC-157 concomitantly will allow you to take any dosage with complete peace of mind since it destroys MTPT/MPP+. Do not use it if you went through benzodiazepine withdrawals that took multiple months or years, as it is a BZD receptor inverse agonist and will precipitate sedative-hypnotic kindling. TLDR; Bromantane to reset natural dopamine biosynthesis, Cerebrolysin/Cortexin/BPC-157 for dopaminergic neurorestorative, 9-MBC for interim stimulant replacement and additional tolerance reversal.</p>
<h2>Optional:</h2>
<h3>Jiaogulan/Gynostemma Pentaphyllum @98% Gypenosides (410-820 mg daily for 6-8 weeks)</h3>
<p>(Take with your biggest meal of the day, but not too close to bedtime). Probably the best thing out there for outright dopaminergic neuron regrowth and restoration of neurite structure, even after extreme oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Subjectively feels calming like an adaptogen, but sometimes makes you lethargic. It's almost as strong as Metformin at reducing blood glucose levels, so take it with your biggest meal. Tons of other health benefits like increased energy and reduced inflammation via AMPK activation and nitric oxide increase, provide stress relief, lowers, blood pressure, and are neuroprotective against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. It's also a potent antioxidant via SOD and glutathione, increases insulin sensitivity, provides remission of allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms via the strengthening of the immune system, and improves heart and liver health. It's also an excellent digestive aid, which leads to consistent bowel movements. Finally, it gives large muscle pumps and strong erections from the NO boost. Longevity Code is a reputable source.</p>
<h3>Mr. Happy Stack (300 mg Uridine Monophosphate + 700 mg DHA + 400mcg Folate for 8-12 weeks)</h3>
<p>Stack for overall cellular growth and DNA repair. Modulates dopamine release, upregulates dopamine receptors (mainly D2), and increases their densities. You might feel lethargic in the beginning, but it goes away. Wasn't too impressed overall, but it should help in theory over a longer period of time. You can add another choline source like Alpha GPC if you're not prone to choline-induced <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Anhedonia">anhedonia</a>/depression. You can buy everything in this stack from iHerb. 3. Phenylpiracetam (100 mg once a week): Reverses tolerance quickly on its own. It increases dopamine receptor density immediately by 16%, 29%, and 62% for D1, D2, and D3 respectively. Also, upregulates GABA-A receptors by 25%. Nootropics Depot is the best source.</p>
<h3>NSI-189 Phosphate (40 mg once daily for 8-12 weeks)</h3>
<p>Has been the greatest antidepressant and tool against anhedonia I have come across personally. You just feel so serene and happy, it's also neurogenic (increases BDNF substantially).</p>
<h3>Agmatine Sulfate (250 mg daily) + Magnesium L-Threonate (144 mg elemental Mg daily)</h3>
<p>Great NMDA antagonists without dissociative side effects which help reverse tolerance and decrease addiction risk (both taken in the morning). They don't have nasty side effects like Memantine. Both can be bought on Nootropics Depot.</p>
<p><br>Obviously a healthy lifestyle (aerobic/anaerobic activity, diet, sleep, etc. should be your baseline. I've personally had the highest success with Bromantane, Cerebrolysin + Cortexin, BPC-157, 9-MBC, Jiaogulan, and NSI-189.</p>
