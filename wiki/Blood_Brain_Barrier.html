<h1>Blood-Brain Barrier</h1>
<p>Bidirectional crosstalk between peripheral players of immunity and the central nervous system (CNS) exists. Hence, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is emerging as a participant mechanism of deregulated peripheralâ€“CNS interplay, promoting diseases. Here, we examine the implication of BBB damage in neurodegeneration, linking it to peripheral brain-directed autoantibodies and gut-brain axis mechanisms. As BBB breakdown is a factor contributing to, or even anticipating, neuronal dysfunction(s), we here identify contemporary pharmacological strategies that could be exploited to repair the BBB in disease conditions. Developing neurovascular, add-on, therapeutic strategies may lead to a more efficacious pre-clinical to clinical transition with the goal of curbing the progression of neurodegeneration.</p>
