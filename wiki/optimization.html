<p><i><strong>Optimization</strong></i> is an important tool in making decisions and in analyzing physical systems. In mathematical terms, an <i><strong>optimization problem</strong></i> is a problem of finding the <i>best</i> solution from among the set of all <i>feasible</i> solutions.</p>
<h1>Constructing a Model</h1>
<p>The first step in the optimization process is constructing an appropriate model; modeling is the process of identifying and expressing in mathematical terms the <strong>objective</strong>, the <strong>variables</strong>, and the <strong>constraints</strong> of the problem.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <i>objective</i> is a quantitative measure of the performance of the system that we want to minimize or maximize. In manufacturing, we may want to maximize the profits or minimize the cost of production, whereas in fitting experimental data to a model, we may want to minimize the total deviation of the observed data from the predicted data.</li>
  <li>The <i>variables</i> or the <i>unknowns</i> are the components of the system for which we want to find values. In manufacturing, the variables may be the amount of each resource consumed, or the time spent on each activity, whereas in data fitting, the variables would be the parameters of the model.</li>
  <li>The <i>constraints</i> are the functions that describe the relationships among the variables and that define the allowable values for the variables. In manufacturing, the amount of a resource consumed cannot exceed the available amount.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Determining the Problem Type</h1>
<p>The second step in the optimization process is determining which category of optimization your model belongs to. The page <a href="https://neos-guide.org/guide/">Types of Optimization Problems</a> provides some guidance to help you classify your optimization model; for the various optimization problem types, there is a linked page with some basic information, links to algorithms and software, and online and print resources.
