<h1>Phenethylamine (PEA)</h1>
<p>Phenethylamine is sold as a dietary supplement for purported mood and weight loss-related therapeutic benefits; however, in orally ingested phenethylamine, a significant amount is metabolized in the small intestine by monoamine oxidase B (<a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/MAO_B">MAO-B</a>) and then aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which converts it to phenylacetic acid. This means that for significant concentrations to reach the brain, the dosage must be higher than for other methods of administration. Some postulated its role in people's falling in love.</p>
<h2><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></h2>
<h3>MAOI Interactions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do not under any circumstances recommend PEA supplementation to <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Parnate">Parnate</a> (or Nardil) users. I gather that you might have meant via supplementation with Phenylalanine you can boost PEA, but it's not clear and someone could get hurt or worse.</p>
  <p>PEA is often dosed upwards of 250mg (without <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors_MAOIs">MAOIs</a>) but with Parnate/Nardil worrying sympathomimetic/cardiovascular effects from PEA can be noted at a mere 20mg. I'd be surprised if 250mg is survivable without medical intervention...</p>
  <p>I learned a very scary lesson with <a href="https://wiki.curedao.org/en/wiki/PEA">PEA</a>. I thought my heart was going to explode and the only thing i could do was pace up and down until it stopped. That was about 20mg on a dose of 45mg of Nardil. -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I took 10mg Selegiline (MAO-B inhibitor) and various amounts of PEA every day for about 2 years. When I first started, it was tricky not to become hypertensive, I really had to titrate the dose of PEA, usually by diluting it in water and sipping it. However, after about 2 weeks of doing this, my body grew accustomed to it somehow and after that hypertension was generally absent or very mild. Mixing with alcohol, however, did bring it back, and particularly red wine, presumably on account of the tyramine in the mix.</p>
  <p>In any case, it's not really a good study drug because the euphoria is too great. The drive to do 'fun' things is irresistible. So, I did find it good for art and music composition, but not for doing the work that I was supposed to be doing.</p>
  <p>It also makes one so incredibly randy that very frequently, all that could be done was to stare at porn for hours on end.</p>
  <p>Conversely, I was able to take it every waking minute of the day without my total dosage needing to exceed about 3-4g PEA per day; i.e., it always remained sufficiently stimulating even after two years.</p>
  <p>It's very, very addictive and basically the experience ruined my life. It's not to say that there were some positive aspects, but on the whole I wish I'd stayed away from it. I ended up in a psychiatric ward after 18 months of only sleeping every other night finally got the better of me and everyone around me.</p>
