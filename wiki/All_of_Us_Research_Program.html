<h1>All of Us Research Program</h1>
<p><i>All of Us</i> is a research program from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal is to help researchers understand more about why people get sick or stay healthy. People who join will share information about their health, habits, and what it's like where they live. By looking for patterns in this information, researchers may learn more about what affects people's health.</p>
<p>Their goal is to get one million or more participants. They've stated they'll share information back with participants over time. They expect the program to last at least ten years.</p>
<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/funding-and-program-partners/data-and-research-center">Data and Research Center</a> is responsible for storing, organizing and providing secure access to the program's data set in a format useful to researchers around the world. Security, privacy and accelerating innovative research are its driving tenets.</p>

<h2><a href="/all-of-us_core_protocol.pdf">Core Protocol</a></h2>
<h2>All of Us Application Programming Interface (API)</h2>
<p>How does data get from the EHR systems, Fitbit, and Participant Portal surveys to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) Data and Research Center (DRC)?</p>
<h2>Nutrition for Precision Health</h2>
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/nutritionforprecisionhealth">NIH Common Fund's Nutrition for Precision Health</a>, powered by the <strong>All of Us</strong> Research Program, is to develop algorithms that predict individual responses to food and dietary patterns. Nutrition plays an integral role in human development and in the prevention and treatment of disease. However, there's no such thing as a perfect, one-size-fits-all diet. The NPH program will build on recent advances in biomedical science including artificial intelligence (AI), and microbiome research, as well as the infrastructure and large, diverse participant group of the <i><strong>All of Us</strong></i> Research Program. These advances provide unprecedented opportunities to generate new data to provide insight into personalized nutrition also referred to as precision nutrition.</p>
<p>In addition, the first ever Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research emphasized opportunities to improve our understanding of how individual human biology and molecular pathways influence relationships among diet and environmental, social, and behavioral factors to influence health. Designed to implement aspects of the Strategic Plan, the <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/Nutrition_for_Precision_Health">Nutrition for Precision Health</a> program will conduct a study nested in the <strong>All of Us</strong> Research Program to explore how individuals respond to different diets. The NPH study is the first ancillary study to leverage the <i>All of Us</i> infrastructure to answer scientific questions important to participants, like understanding more about the role of nutrition in health. &nbsp;High-quality nutrition studies such as the NPH study will help individuals and their health care providers create healthy, precise, and effective diet plans.</p>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The source code for the <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/All_of_Us_Research_Program_Research_Workbench">research workbench</a> is available at <a href="https://github.com/all-of-us">https://github.com/all-of-us</a>. This appears to be an organization containing internal code, not accepting outside contributions.</p>
<p>There's another All of Us Research Program GitHub organization at <a href="https://github.com/All-of-Us-Research-Program">https://github.com/All-of-Us-Research-Program</a>. It's unclear what differentiates these two organizations.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can we create a suggestions page to allow users to suggest features and vote on them?</li>
  <li>Is there a high-level diagram of the overall architecture of the participant portal - Vanderbilt data lake - research platform?</li>
  <li>Do you have any links to more information about the mood tracking app you plan to introduce? Is it built? Will it be part of the participant portal or a separate entity? Who's building it?</li>
  <li>Does All of Us have a public technical question-and-answer forum or wiki that developers can use to ask questions about technical aspects of your project?</li>
  <li>Do you currently have a private API that could potentially receive and store participant data?</li>
</ul>
