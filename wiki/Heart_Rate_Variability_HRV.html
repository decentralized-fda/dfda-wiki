<h1>Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</h1>
<p>HRV is a measure of the variation in time between each heartbeat.</p>
<h1>Autonomic Nervous System</h1>
<p>This variation is controlled by a primitive part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It works regardless of our desire and regulates, among other things, our heart rate, <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/Blood_Pressure">blood pressure</a>, breathing, and digestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ANS is subdivided into two large components, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the fight-or-flight mechanism and the relaxation response.</p>
