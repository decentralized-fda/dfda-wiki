<h1>MAO-A</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monoamine">Monoamine</a> oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a FAD-dependent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/mitochondrial-enzyme">mitochondrial enzyme</a>, which, together with its <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/isoenzyme">isoenzyme</a> MAO-B, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of structurally diverse amines Cesura and Pletscher (1992), Kalgutkar et al. (2001). MAO-A is mainly involved in the metabolism of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monoamine">monoamine</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/neurotransmitter">neurotransmitters</a>, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Although there is no clear distinction between MAO-A and MAO-B selective substrates, evidence indicates that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/noradrenalin">norepinephrine</a> and 5-hydroxytryptamine are mainly substrates for MAO-A, with dopamine being deaminated by both isoforms, likely in a region-specific manner. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/adrenergic-receptor-stimulating-agent">sympathomimetic</a> amine <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tyramine">tyramine</a> shows similar K<sub>m</sub> values for MAO-A and MAO-B, but appears to be mainly metabolized by MAO-A in the gastrointestinal tract Hasan et al. (1988) and in sympathetic noradrenergic neurons.</p>
<p>Inhibitors of MAO-A are in clinical use for affective disorders. On a historical note, the serendipitous finding that the tubercolostatic agent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/iproniazid">iproniazide</a> had antidepressant properties and inhibited MAO paved the way for modern pharmacopsychiatry. Iproniazide can be considered the first antidepressant introduced into clinical practice, Pletscher (1991).</p>
