# Overview

The Wikipedia model demonstrates the tremendous power of crowdsourcing and open collaboration. Despite Microsoft spending billions of dollars hiring thousands of expert PhDs to create Encarta, Wikipedia garnered over 50 times more content in just a few years - all from volunteers. Moreover, studies have shown Wikipedia's accuracy on scientific topics rivals leading encyclopedias. 

The Decentralized FDA aims to produce a 50X accerleration in clinical discovery by replicating this model for clinical research. By crowdsourcing real-world data and observations from patients, clinicians, and researchers, the Decentralized FDA could enable orders of magnitude more insights and discovery than the current closed research system. 

Rather than a few expensive clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies, the Decentralized FDA would facilitate a massive decentralized clinical trial encompassing millions of patients. This "Wikipedization" of evidence-based research can unlock lifesaving knowledge at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional methods. Just as Wikipedia democratized access to knowledge, the Decentralized FDA can democratize health research and empower people with actionable data to improve lives.

# Problems We're Trying To Solve Here

The existing regulatory framework for drug approval presents several challenges, hindering the efficiency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical research and public health advancements:

- **Prolonged Time and High Costs:** It takes over a decade and \$2.6 billion on average to bring a drug to market, with Phase III clinical trials costing around \$41k per subject.
- **Limited Knowledge on Unpatentable Molecules:** There is a significant lack of data on the long-term effects of the majority of synthetic or natural compounds, as there is insufficient incentive to research non-patentable molecules.
- **Inadequate Exploration of Off-Patent Treatments:** There is a lack of financial incentive to approve drugs for additional conditions after their patent expires, leaving potential treatments for rare diseases unexplored.
- **Absence of Long-Term Outcome Data:** Due to financial constraints, long-term effects of drugs are often unknown.
- **Publication Bias:** Negative results are frequently unreported, leading to redundant research efforts and wasted resources.
- **Exclusion of Diverse Patient Populations:** Clinical trials often exclude a vast majority of the patient population, limiting the generalizability of findings.
- **Vast Amount of Unresearched Combinations:** The immense number of possible molecule-disease combinations leaves 99.9999998% of potential knowledge undiscovered.
- **Bias Towards Rejecting Effective Treatments:** Cognitive biases and personal risk aversion among regulators result in a tendency to reject potentially life-saving treatments.

To overcome these perverse incentives and biases, implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) regulatory body is proposed. This would distribute responsibility among a large group of experts, mitigating individual risk and bias, and fostering a more balanced, efficient, and innovative drug approval process. ðŸ‘‰ [Learn More](/problems-in-clinical-research)
