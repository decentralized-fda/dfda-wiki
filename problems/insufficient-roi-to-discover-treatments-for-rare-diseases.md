It costs over a billion dollars to develop a new treatment, largely due to regulatory burdens.

Victims of rare diseases suffer the greatest harm from this, as it's not economically feasible to recover the costs of development from a few patients.

So out of desperation, many have created communities on Discord severs and Reddit, where they conduct underground self-experimentation.

Regardless of the wisdom of this approach, this experimentation is going to continue. Hence, the dFDA should promote harm reduction strategies, provide protocols, and collect this data.
