# Markdown Linking Policy

Always reference workspace files and external sources using proper markdown hyperlinks. Do NOT present file paths, URLs, or cross‑refs inside inline code backticks when the intent is to link.

## Workspace file links
- Use standard markdown links with a page‑relative path (./, ../), not repo‑root paths.
- Same folder: [This Doc’s README](./README.md)
- Parent folder: [Legal Compliance Framework](../strategy/legal-compliance-framework.md)
- Sibling path (from a doc in docs/): [Fundraising Models Comparison](../strategy/fundraising-models-comparison.md)
- Incorrect: `strategy/legal-compliance-framework.md`, bare repo‑root paths like (strategy/legal-compliance-framework.md)

## Multiple links in a sentence
- Write (from docs/): See also: [Legal Compliance Framework](../strategy/legal-compliance-framework.md), [Fundraising Models Comparison](../strategy/fundraising-models-comparison.md), and [Crypto Intake SOP](./crypto-intake-sop.md).

## External links
- Use descriptive anchor text and standard markdown links.
- Write: See [SEC Regulation A overview](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rega).
- Avoid bare URLs or backticked URLs.

## Sections and anchors
- Link to headings/anchors when helpful.
- Example (from strategy/): [Estimation Framework](fundraising-models-comparison.md#estimation-framework-how-much-each-channel-can-raise)

## Code vs links
- Use backticks only for code, commands, or literals—not for navigational references to documents.
- If you must display a path as text (no link), prefer plain text without backticks unless it appears inside code context.
