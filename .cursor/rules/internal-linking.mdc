# Internal Linking Policy (Workspace-Wide)

Always create internal markdown links when referencing other pages in this repo. Do not reference file paths in plain text or backticks when the intent is navigation.

## Core Rules

- Use standard markdown links with page‑relative paths (./, ../). Do NOT use bare URLs or inline code for links.
- Link to specific sections/anchors whenever helpful. Prefer heading anchors. If an anchor is not obvious, add a local anchor in the target file.
- Maintain bidirectional links between tightly coupled docs (e.g., process maps ↔ roadmap, landing page ↔ tokenomics, etc.).
- Follow the workspace “Markdown Linking Policy” and “Sourcing and Citation Standard.”

## Required Behaviors

1) When referencing another page, add an internal link:
   - Example: See [War on Disease Landing](strategy/warondisease-landing.md).

2) When referencing a section, link to its anchor:
   - Example: [Source Quotes for Key Parameters](strategy/warondisease-landing.md#source-quotes-for-key-parameters).

3) Processes ↔ Roadmap (Phase Linking):
   - In process lists (e.g., [Operations Process Index](operations/process-index.md)), link the Phase(s) label to the matching roadmap phase heading:
     - Phase 1: [Foundation & Legal Framework](strategy/roadmap.md#phase-1-foundation--legal-framework-months-1-12)
     - Phase 2: [Capital & Political Mobilization](strategy/roadmap.md#phase-2-capital--political-mobilization-months-12-36)
     - Phase 3: [Execution & Impact](strategy/roadmap.md#phase-3-execution--impact-years-3-5)
   - In the roadmap, include a “See also” link back to the Operations Process Index.

4) When adding new cross‑refs, prefer linking to canonical docs:
   - Tokenomics → [\$VICTORY Instruments — Tokenomics](strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md)
   - Legal → [Legal Compliance Framework](strategy/legal-compliance-framework.md)
   - DIH Overview → [Decentralized Institutes of Health](strategy/1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md)
   - Peace Dividend → [Value Capture & Distribution](economic-models/peace-dividend-value-capture.md)

## Anchors: If in doubt, add them

- If a heading’s auto‑generated anchor is unclear, add an explicit anchor right above the heading in the target doc:
  - Example in the target doc:
    <a id="phase-1"></a>
    ## Phase 1: Foundation & Legal Framework (Months 1–12)

## Examples (Do This)

- “Phase(s): Starts in [Phase 1](strategy/roadmap.md#phase-1-foundation--legal-framework-months-1-12); runs in [Phase 2](strategy/roadmap.md#phase-2-capital--political-mobilization-months-12-36) and [Phase 3](strategy/roadmap.md#phase-3-execution--impact-years-3-5).”
- “See [Operations Process Index](operations/process-index.md) for owners, WIGs, and lead/lag checks.”

## Anti‑patterns (Don’t Do This)

Avoid plain text mentions of other files. Avoid backticked file paths for navigation. Avoid bare URLs in body text when an internal page exists.
