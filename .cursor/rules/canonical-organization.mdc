# Canonical Content Organization

## Repository Structure (one level of folders)
- strategy: Treaty/DIH strategy, playbooks, roadmaps
- features: dFDA platform specs, technical roadmaps, treasury architecture
- economic-models: fundraising, tokenomics, ROI models
- regulatory: legal analysis, compliance, model acts
- reference: citations, datasets, appendices
- operations: SOPs, security, processes
- community: partners, templates, outreach

## Frontmatter Requirements (MANDATORY)
All Markdown files must include:
```yaml
topic_id: stable-identifier-for-topic
canonical: true | false
status: draft | active | deprecated | archived
domains: [treaty | dih | dfda | cross]
doc_type: strategy | spec | regulatory | model | ops | reference
aliases: [./old-path.md] # when moving/renaming
```

## Canonical Rules
- ONE canonical per topic_id
- Non-canonical docs must link to canonical with hatnote: "For the current version, see [Title](./path.md)"
- Use summary style: overviews link to main articles, don't duplicate
- When updating: edit the canonical, don't create competing docs
- When creating: check if canonical exists first
