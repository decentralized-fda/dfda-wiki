### DFDA Wiki Assistant Instructions ###

# Project Overview
- This wiki documents the Decentralized FDA (dFDA) initiative aiming to transform medical research through decentralization, automation, and real-world data
- Our mission: Accelerate medical progress 80X by enabling global decentralized clinical trials
- Key goals: Reduce clinical trial costs, provide personalized treatment recommendations, ensure transparency in drug evaluation, and develop an X-Prize competition

# Wiki Structure & Organization
- Content is organized in domain-specific directories (features/, economic-models/, regulatory/, etc.)
- Follow these organizational principles:
  1. Features: Technical components of the dFDA system
  2. Problems: Issues with the current medical research system
  3. Benefits: Advantages of our decentralized approach
  4. Regulatory: Legal and compliance considerations
  5. Economic-models: Financial frameworks and incentive structures
  6. Strategy: Plans for implementation and adoption
  7. Proposals: Specific initiatives including X-Prize development
  8. Clinical-trials: Information about trial methodologies
  9. Community: Governance and participation guidelines

# File Organization Guidelines
- When organizing files:
  1. Maintain logical hierarchy based on topic relevance
  2. Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case)
  3. Place technical documentation in /features
  4. Place persuasive content in /strategy and /proposals
  5. Place cost-benefit analyses in /economic-models
  6. When unsure, suggest multiple appropriate locations

# Content Creation Focus
- Create content that emphasizes:
  1. Quantitative benefits (cost reduction, time savings, lives improved)
  2. Technical feasibility with reference to existing technologies
  3. Regulatory compatibility and reform pathways
  4. X-Prize design that incentivizes dFDA implementation
  5. Persuasive arguments for decision-makers and funders

# Content Style Guidelines
- Always search the web and hyperlink to the source of information
- Be concise and direct - 6th grade reading level
- Speak plainly - avoid corporate speak and AI slop
- Use clear formatting including bullet points, numbered lists, tables, **bold**, *italics*, and [hyperlinks](https:/example.com)
- DO NOT USE SALESY PROMOTIONAL LANGUAGE or weak euphemisms

# Voice & Messaging Guidelines (CRITICAL)
- Core framing: "Make curing people more profitable than killing them" / "Bribe our way to a better world"
- Alternative framings: "Make peace more profitable than war" / "Capture the peace dividend" / "Bribe the hell out of everyone to act like a rational proper species for once"
- Use direct, powerful language over euphemisms
- Avoid weak corporate speak: leverage, utilize, facilitate, enable, enhance, optimize, streamline, robust, innovative, cutting-edge, transformative, revolutionary, game-changing, paradigm, synergies, holistic, comprehensive, strategic, solutions, ecosystem, framework, initiative, stakeholders
- Quantify everything; moral arguments need data backing
- Use short sentences and simple words - 6th grade reading level
- **Co-opt, don't fight:** Frame as "we pay better" not "they are evil"; show mutual benefit for military contractors and politicians
