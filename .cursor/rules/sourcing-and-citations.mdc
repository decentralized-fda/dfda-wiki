# Sourcing and Citation Standard (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY**: ALL factual claims, statistics, figures, and assertions MUST be cited with hyperlinks to authoritative sources. No exceptions.

To ensure credibility, all factual claims must be cited. Follow this procedure:

1.  **Find a High-Quality Source**: Use web search tools (e.g., `mcp_exa_web_search_exa`) for reputable sources like academic journals, government reports, or major news outlets.

2.  **Hyperlink In-Text**: Add a markdown link `[claim](source_url)` directly at the point of the claim.

### Optional: Using Internal Anchors for Better UX
To keep users on the site longer and reduce external navigation, you can link in-text claims to an internal anchor in the source quotes section instead of directly to the external URL. This creates a "hub" for sources.

- **In-Text**: Use `[claim](#anchor-id)`.
- **Anchor Definition**: Add `<a id="anchor-id"></a>` before the relevant quote in the source section.
- **External Link**: Place the full URL in the source quote as usual.

Example In-Text:
```markdown
...global military spending reached [\$2.443 trillion](#global-spending)...
```

In Source Section:
```markdown
<a id="global-spending"></a>
* **Global Spending**
  > "Quote."
  > — Source, Date, [URL](https://example.com)
```

This is optional but recommended for user retention—external links are still accessible one click away.

3.  **Add Source Quote Section**: At the end of the file, create a section (e.g., `### Source Quotes for Key Parameters`) if it doesn't exist.

4.  **Add Full Citation**: In the source section, add:
    *   A label for the claim: `* **Claim Label**`
    *   The supporting quote: `> "Direct quote from source..."`
    *   The citation: `— Source Name, Date, [URL](source_url)`

## Example

### In-Text Claim:
```markdown
...the total investment required to fund a global dFDA platform initiative...can be estimated to be in the range of **\$50 million to \$500 million**, with market leaders like **Medable** raising over **[\$521 million](https:/hitconsultant.net/2021/10/26/medable-dct-series-d-funding)**.
```

### At the End of the File:
```markdown
### Source Quotes for Key Parameters

* **\$521M raised by Medable**
  > "Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCT) leader Medable, today announced a \$304M Series D funding round today – the company's largest and fourth funding round in 18 months, bringing total capital raised to \$521M – and valuation to \$2B+."
