## TITLE I ‚Äî SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS

### SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the **"Right‚Äëto‚ÄëTrial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025."**

### SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The current healthcare and medical research system suffers from critical inefficiencies and inequities:
    (a) ‚è≥ **Bureaucratic and Regulatory Delays:** Life-saving treatments are often delayed by 7-12 years from discovery to patient access ([Tufts CSDD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079318/); [Nature Reviews Drug Discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3078)).
    (b) üö´ **Exclusion from Clinical Trials:** Approximately [97% of patients](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/111/3/245/5307078) (and [85% by other estimates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985)) are excluded from or unable to participate in clinical trials, denying access to potentially life-saving investigational treatments and limiting the generalizability of trial results. Less than [10 percent](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311) of U.S. patients enroll in interventional clinical trials; distance, eligibility restrictions, and direct costs are principal barriers ([ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10523812/)).
    (c) üí∞ **Excessive Drug Development Costs:** The average cost to develop a new treatment is approximately [$2.6 billion](https://csdd.tufts.edu/csddnews/2018/3/9/march-2016-tufts-csdd-rd-cost-study) (with some estimates at [$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311)). Median per‚Äëpatient cost for a phase‚Äë3 drug trial in 2024 exceeded [$43,000](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1740774516629510), inflating drug prices and limiting R‚Äë&‚ÄëD on unpatentable therapies. These costs are ultimately passed on to patients, insurers, and taxpayers ([Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210914.682561/full/)).
    (d) üìà **Misaligned Research Incentives:** A significant portion of research and development, estimated at [80% by some sources](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-40), focuses on treatments with high profit potential rather than on those with the greatest public health impact or on affordable alternatives ([NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1610301)).
    (e) ‚è±Ô∏è **Prolonged Waits for Breakthrough Therapies:** Patients with terminal or life-altering conditions often wait [4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals](https://www.fda.gov/media/151060/download).
    (f) üåç **Delayed Access Compared to Other Nations:** Approval and availability of new treatments in the United States can [lag 3-5 years behind](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1610301) approvals in other developed nations ([FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/151060/download)).
    (g) üíä **Lack of Treatments for Most Diseases:** An estimated [95% of diseases](https://ncats.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NCATS_RareDiseasesFactSheet.pdf) have no FDA-approved treatment, leaving millions of patients with limited options.
    (h) üìä **Neglect of Real-World Evidence:** The current system often fails to systematically collect, analyze, and integrate real-world evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments across diverse patient populations.
    (i) üôà **Publication Bias:** Negative or inconclusive trial results are often unpublished, leading to redundant research efforts and a skewed understanding of treatment efficacy.
    (j) ü•´ **Data Scarcity on Unpatentable Interventions:** There is a significant lack of data on the long-term effects and comparative effectiveness of unpatentable interventions, including many foods, dietary patterns, and existing repurposed drugs.
    (k) üóì **Insufficient Long-Term Outcome Data:** Many clinical trials are of short duration, providing limited information on the long-term benefits and risks of treatments.

(2) Modern technology and decentralized approaches, as demonstrated by initiatives like the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/), offer the potential to dramatically accelerate medical research, reduce costs by up to 80-95%, and improve patient access to care. The U.K. **RECOVERY** pragmatic trial enrolled [49,000 patients in 100 days at roughly $500 per patient](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/uk-recovery-trial-reaches-50000-patients/27716), demonstrating 90 percent cost reduction via adaptive, decentralized design.

(3) Patients have a fundamental interest in making informed decisions about their healthcare, including the option to participate in well-regulated clinical trials for investigational treatments when existing options are insufficient.

(4) An open, transparent, and publicly accessible platform for clinical trial data, treatment outcomes, and regulatory information can empower patients, clinicians, and researchers, fostering innovation and public trust. Publicly financed, algorithm‚Äëtargeted subsidies that maximize **quality‚Äëadjusted life‚Äëyears (QALYs) per federal dollar** can democratize access while a modest patient co‚Äëpayment curbs moral hazard.

(5) A single, open‚Äësource **FDA v2 Digital Platform**‚Äîwith e‚Äëprotocol builders, liability‚Äëinsurance bidding, blockchain custody, and AI‚Äëranked treatment lists‚Äîwill enable any willing patient to join a trial of the most‚Äëpromising therapy for their condition.

(6) Modernizing FDA regulation to embrace real‚Äëworld evidence, remote monitoring, and validated non‚Äëanimal test methods will accelerate safe cures.

### SEC. 103. PURPOSE.

The purposes of this Act are‚Äî

(1) To establish and guarantee the right of eligible patients to participate in approved clinical trials for investigational treatments for their conditions, particularly when currently available treatments are ineffective or unsatisfactory.
(2) To mandate the creation, operation, and continuous improvement of the "FDA v2 Digital Platform," a publicly owned, open-source, and interoperable digital platform for managing all aspects of clinical research, treatment information, and regulatory processes.
(3) To dramatically reduce the cost and time associated with clinical trials by leveraging decentralized methodologies, automation, real-world data, and the FDA v2 Digital Platform.
(4) To ensure comprehensive, transparent, and unbiased collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on the safety and effectiveness of all treatments, including through standardized "Outcome Labels" and comparative effectiveness rankings.
(5) To foster a collaborative and innovative research ecosystem by making anonymized research data, tools, and platform functionalities openly available.
(6) To establish an AI-powered system, integrated within the FDA v2 Digital Platform as Platform Intelligence (FDAi), to support patients, researchers, and regulators by analyzing data, providing personalized insights, and enhancing regulatory oversight.
(7) To realign financial incentives to reward the development of cures, preventative interventions, and treatments that provide significant value to patients and public health.

(a) **Right (Guarantee).** Beginning 24 months after enactment, any U.S. resident with a qualifying condition who requests an investigational intervention **shall be guaranteed enrolment‚Äîremotely if necessary‚Äîin at least one pragmatic, decentralized trial arm evaluating that intervention**, provided the patient meets minimal safety criteria in subsection (c) and other conditions set forth in this Title. This right is to be exercised through the FDA v2 Digital Platform.
(b) **Sponsor Incentive.** The Secretary shall award a **transferable Priority‚ÄëReview Voucher (PRV)** under section 524A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to any sponsor that, on or before the universal‚Äëenrolment activation date, opens or amends a trial on the FDA v2 Digital Platform to accept such patient‚Äëdirected enrolment and maintains adequate investigational‚Äëproduct supply. A PRV is forfeited if the sponsor later restricts patient enrolment without a documented safety or manufacturing constraint.
(c) **Eligible Patient Criteria and Safety‚ÄëBased Exclusions Only.**
    (1) An individual shall be considered an "eligible patient" if they: (A) have been diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, or a chronic condition for which existing approved treatments are unsatisfactory, have failed, or are not tolerated; (B) have consulted with a licensed physician knowledgeable about their condition and the investigational treatment, who attests that there are no comparable satisfactory approved options and potential benefits outweigh risks; (C) are capable of providing, and have provided, written informed consent; and (D) meet specific trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, unless a waiver is granted. The referring physician must not be the sponsor or an investigator of the specific trial unless conflict of interest mitigation is approved.
    (2) Sponsors or IRBs may exclude an individual patient **solely for documented, evidence‚Äëbased safety reasons** (e.g., a specific contraindication, allergy, or organ‚Äësystem risk) or if investigational‚Äëproduct supply is demonstrably insufficient. Exclusion rationales must be transmitted to the FDA Dashboard within 7 days and are subject to FDA audit.
(d) **NIH Micro‚ÄëStudy Fallback.** If no sponsor operates an active investigational‚Äënew‚Äëdrug application that can accept the patient within 60 days of request, the NIH‚Äîusing Other Transaction Authority‚Äîshall initiate a single‚Äëarm or adaptive micro‚Äëstudy to provide the intervention under IND and collect outcomes via the Platform; such micro‚Äëstudies qualify for subsidies under ¬ß‚ÄØ303.
(e) **Adaptive Enrolment.** Sponsors participating under this section must accept data‚Äëdriven lowering of exclusion criteria unless an IRB documents incremental safety risk.
(f) **No Entitlement to Unapproved Treatments Outside of Trials**: This section does not create an entitlement to an investigational treatment outside the context of a clinical trial approved and conducted via the FDA v2 Digital Platform.

### SEC. 302. PATIENT PROTECTIONS, CONSENT, AND LIABILITY.

(a) **Central IRB.** All Right‚Äëto‚ÄëTrial protocols shall undergo single‚ÄëIRB review per 45 CFR ¬ß‚ÄØ46.114\[8]; FDA shall publish a master reliance agreement.
(b) **Informed Consent.**
    (1) Platform e‚Äëconsent shall disclose investigational nature, trial procedures, known/unknown risks (as per Outcome Label and protocol), potential benefits, alternatives, confidentiality extent, injury compensation, contact information, voluntary participation statement, and data use/sharing for continuous improvement.
    (2) Execution of the e‚Äëconsent **constitutes both 45 CFR ¬ß‚ÄØ164.508 authorization and, where applicable, a waiver of authorization under ¬ß‚ÄØ164.512(i)\[11] for research use of protected health information**, as approved by the reviewing IRB; signed consent is hashed and stored on the blockchain ledger.
(c) **Safety Monitoring.** Sponsors must stream adverse‚Äëevent data to the Dashboard within 24 hours; FDA may halt enrolment under 21 CFR ¬ß‚ÄØ312.42.
(d) **Liability Shield.** Good‚Äëfaith compliance grants immunity from tort claims except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; mirrors Pub. L. 115‚Äë176 ¬ß‚ÄØ2(c). Liability for harm shall be addressed via applicable law and sponsor's liability insurance.
(e) **Patient Responsibilities**: Patients exercising their Right to Trial are responsible for adhering to trial protocols, reporting outcomes and adverse events accurately and in a timely manner, and maintaining communication with the trial team.
(f) **Data Contribution and Use**: As a condition of participation, patients consent to collection and use of their anonymized/de-identified trial data for purposes outlined in this Act. Patients retain ownership of identifiable health information and the Platform shall provide tools for privacy preference management consistent with research integrity.

### SEC. 303. NIH PARTICIPATION SUBSIDIES.

(a) **Fund.** A revolving Clinical‚ÄëTrial Participation Subsidy Fund is established; authorized to receive \$2 billion FY 2026‚Äì30.
(b) **Allocation Algorithm.** NIH shall develop, publish, and annually recompute an open optimisation model for the allocation of subsidies. This model shall aim to maximize public health value, primarily assessed by **(1) projected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per dollar of subsidy, (2) the potential for significant healthcare system cost savings, and (3) the marginal scientific value of the research, including the value of reducing uncertainty for interventions with limited existing evidence but high potential impact.** The algorithm shall incorporate factors such as disease prevalence/severity, impact on morbidity/mortality, number/diversity of participants needed, marginal value of additional data, and socioeconomic barriers. The algorithm and its parameters shall be published, subject to public comment, and updated at least annually to reflect advances in evidence, policy priorities, and stakeholder feedback. It shall be designed to dynamically incorporate new evidence on treatment efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness as it is generated through the FDA v2 Digital Platform.
(c) **Payments.** NIH pays sponsors per enrolled participant up to the algorithmic cap; sponsors certify costs and submit outcomes. The subsidy system shall be transparent, equitable, and designed to maximize both patient access and societal value of research.
(d) **Audit.** GAO shall audit fund disbursements biennially; claw‚Äëback for mis‚Äëcertified costs.

### SEC. 304. PATIENT COST‚ÄëSHARING AND INSURANCE.

(a) **Minimum Co‚Äëpayment.** Each participant shall pay a non‚Äëzero fee set by the Secretary between the 25th and 75th percentile of commercial‚Äëinsurance specialist‚Äëvisit copays for the preceding year, **adjusted annually by the CPI‚ÄëU** (initially \$15‚Äì\$40 per visit).
(b) **Cap and Cost Disclosure.** Sponsors may not bill participants beyond the statutory co‚Äëpay; NIH subsidy + sponsor absorb remaining costs. Cost schedule and co‚Äëpay displayed in e‚Äëconsent; participants may terminate if costs subsequently rise. The Act does not mandate sponsors provide investigational products free of charge, but sponsors must clearly state any costs to the patient on the Platform, which shall facilitate access to financial assistance information.
(c) **Routine Care Costs.** Health insurance plans shall not deny coverage for routine medical care that a patient would otherwise be entitled to receive, solely on the basis of their participation in a clinical trial under this Act. Disputes shall be resolved through a mechanism established by the Secretary.

### Introduction to Cost-Benefit Analysis

The current healthcare system faces significant challenges, including high drug development costs, lengthy approval processes, limited patient access to clinical trials, and escalating drug prices. The **Right‚Äëto‚ÄëTrial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025** aims to address these issues by overhauling the drug development and approval process, leveraging technology, and aligning financial incentives with health outcomes. This analysis provides a quantitative evaluation of the Act's potential economic benefits and costs.

### Key Components of the Act Relevant to Economic Impact

- **FDA v2 Digital Platform**: Creation of a free, open-source platform for clinical trials, incorporating FDAi.
- **Right-to-Trial Program**: Guaranteed right for patients to try treatments.
- **Transparency in Regulatory Actions (SEC. 405)**: Mandate for cost-benefit and impact analyses for FDA actions and all regulatory instruments.
- **Global Drug Importation & Data Harmonization**: Allowing importation and recognizing international data.
- **Financial Incentives for Cures & NIH Subsidy Reform**: Sharing healthcare savings and optimizing research funding.

### Quantified Benefits

#### 1. Clinical Trial Cost Savings

*   **Current Costs:** Average drug development cost ~[$2.6 billion per drug](https://csdd.tufts.edu/csddnews/2018/3/9/march-2016-tufts-csdd-rd-cost-study), with clinical trials comprising ~60% (~$1.56 billion).
*   **Proposed Savings:** The FDA v2 Digital Platform and decentralized trial methodologies aim for up to 90% reduction in trial costs.
    *   Savings per drug: \$1.56 billion * 0.90 = \$1.404 billion.
    *   Assuming 50 new drugs annually: \$1.404 billion/drug √ó 50 drugs = **\$70.2 billion annually**.

#### 2. Savings from Disease Prevention and Better Treatments

*   **Current Spending:** U.S. annual healthcare expenditure ~[$4.1 trillion](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet), with [90% on chronic diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html). Current preventive care spending ~[5%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/what-do-we-know-about-spending-related-to-public-health-in-the-u-s-and-comparable-countries/).
*   **Potential Savings:** Act encourages research into unpatentable interventions, prevention, and more effective treatments through better data.
    *   If increased focus on prevention (e.g., doubling effective preventive spending from \$205B to \$410B) with a 3:1 ROI: (\$410B - \$205B) * 2 (net gain after spend) = **\$410 billion annually**. (Note: This is an indirect effect incentivized by the Act through SEC. 402(c)).
    *   More rapid development and deployment of superior treatments leading to reduced hospitalizations, long-term care needs. Difficult to quantify precisely but potentially hundreds of billions.

#### 3. Drug Price Reductions through Competition and Transparency

*   **Current Costs:** Annual U.S. prescription drug spending ~[$360 billion](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/what-do-we-know-about-spending-related-to-public-health-in-the-u-s-and-comparable-countries/). U.S. prices often [50-90% higher](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/prescription-drug-pricing-research-series-summary-reports-0).
*   **Potential Savings:** Facilitating importation (SEC. 203(d)), faster generic/biosimilar entry, and price transparency via the Platform could lead to significant price reductions.
    *   A conservative 20-30% average reduction on a portion of the market: \$360 billion * (e.g., 50% of market affected) * 0.25 = **\$45 billion annually**.

#### 4. Economic Benefits from Faster Time-to-Market

*   **Current Situation:** 7-12 years for drug development ([Tufts CSDD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079318/)).
*   **Proposed Improvements:** The Act aims to reduce this by several years.
    *   Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) ~[$10 million](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation). If faster access saves even a modest number of QALYs or lives across various diseases:
    *   Example: 10,000 QALYs saved/year * [$150,000/QALY](https://icer.org/our-approach/methods-process/value-assessment-framework/) = $1.5 billion annually.

#### 5. Value of Information from Comprehensive Impact Analyses (SEC. 405)

*   **Current Situation:** Limited systematic, quantitative cost-benefit analysis of all FDA regulations and actions.
*   **Proposed Improvements:** SEC. 405 mandates such analyses.
    *   Improved regulatory decisions informed by rigorous CBA can prevent costly, ineffective, or harmful regulations and optimize resource allocation.
    *   If these analyses lead to even a 1% improvement in the efficiency of the [~$600B+ FDA-regulated product market](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance) (excluding food), benefits could be $6 billion+ annually.

**Conservative Aggregated Annual Benefits Estimate:** \$70.2B (trials) + \$50B (conservative prevention/better treatment - very conservative) + \$45B (prices) + \$5B (faster market access - very conservative) + \$6B (better regulation) = **Approximately \$176.2 billion annually.** (This is a floor; actuals could be much higher, especially from prevention/better treatments and more optimistic faster market access scenarios).

### Estimated Costs

#### 1. Implementation Costs (Platform, FDAi, Oversight)

*   **FDA Upgrade & Platform Operations (SEC. 402(a))**: \$500 million authorized over 5 years. Assuming front-loaded for initial critical mass development: **\$200-300 million** in early years for development.
*   **Transition Costs (Training, Regulatory Overhaul):** Could be **\$50-100 million** for new guidance, training modules, system integration efforts.
*   **Independent Oversight Office for SEC. 405 (establishment):** **\$5-10 million**.
*   **Total Initial Setup Costs (spread over 1-3 years):** **~\$255-410 million** (Significantly less than original CBA's broader estimate, focusing on direct Act authorizations).

#### 2. Ongoing Operational Costs

*   **FDA v2 Digital Platform & FDAi Annual Operation (SEC. 402(a))**: Average \$100M/year from authorization, plus direct hire staff (200 technical staff * ~$200k avg burdened cost = $40M). Total **~\$140 million annually** for platform and core staff.
*   **NIH Participation Subsidies (SEC. 303, SEC. 402(b))**: \$2 billion over 5 years = **\$400 million annually**. (This is a transfer payment but also an investment in research).
*   **Regulatory-Science & Unpatentable Intervention Grants (SEC. 402(c))**: \$150 million over 5 years = **\$30 million annually**.
*   **Ongoing Cost of Comprehensive Impact Analyses (SEC. 405(e)(4)(A))**: This mandates dedicated resources from NIH budget. If 0.1% of NIH's ~$50B budget: **\$50 million annually**.
*   **Independent Oversight Office & Audits (SEC. 405(e)(5), SEC. 303(d))**: Ongoing operations and GAO audits: **\$5-10 million annually**.
*   **Total Estimated Annual Operational Costs (excluding subsidies as pure cost, as they are investments):** \$140M + \$30M + \$50M + \$10M = **~\$230 million annually.**
*   **Total Annual Costs (including full subsidy fund as an expenditure for CBA purposes):** \$230M + \$400M = **~\$630 million annually.**

### Cost-Benefit Comparison

*   **Total Estimated Annual Benefits (Conservative Floor):** **~\$176.2 billion**
*   **Total Estimated Annual Operational Costs (including subsidies):** **~\$630 million**
*   **Net Annual Benefit (Conservative):** **~\$175.57 billion**
*   **Initial One-Time Setup Costs:** **~\$255-410 million**

The benefits appear to overwhelmingly outweigh the costs. The investment in the NIH Subsidy fund also aims to generate further health and economic value beyond its direct cost.

### Conclusion of Cost-Benefit Analysis

The **Right‚Äëto‚ÄëTrial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025** presents a compelling economic case. The initial investment and ongoing operational costs, as outlined and authorized within the Act, are relatively modest compared to the potential multi-billion dollar annual savings and health improvements. The provisions in SEC. 405, while adding analytical costs, promise to yield significant returns by ensuring all FDA regulatory activities are demonstrably in the public interest.

### Assumptions and Limitations for Cost-Benefit Analysis

*   Benefit estimates are based on available data and literature but involve significant extrapolation.
*   Percentage reductions (e.g., in trial costs, drug prices) are targets; actual achievement may vary.
*   Behavioral responses of industry, patients, and regulators are difficult to predict precisely.
*   The value of QALYs and VSL can be debated, though standard figures are used.
*   This analysis simplifies complex interactions within the healthcare and pharmaceutical ecosystem.
*   Cost estimates are primarily based on authorizations within the Act, actual appropriations and expenditures may vary.
