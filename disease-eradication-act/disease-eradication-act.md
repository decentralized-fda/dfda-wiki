# Rightâ€‘toâ€‘Trial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025

**Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,**

---

## TITLE I â€” SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS

### SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the **"Rightâ€‘toâ€‘Trial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025."**

### SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

1. Less than **10 percent** of U.S. patients enroll in interventional clinical trials;\[1] distance, eligibility restrictions, and direct costs are principal barriers.
2. Median perâ€‘patient cost for a phaseâ€‘3 drug trial in 2024 exceeded **\$43,000**\[2], inflating drug prices and limiting Râ€‘&â€‘D on unpatentable therapies.
3. The U.K. **RECOVERY** pragmatic trial enrolled 49,000 patients in 100 days at roughly **\$500 per patient**\[3], demonstrating 90 percent cost reduction via adaptive, decentralized design.
4. Publicly financed, algorithmâ€‘targeted subsidies that maximize **qualityâ€‘adjusted lifeâ€‘years (QALYs) per federal dollar** can democratize access while a modest patient coâ€‘payment curbs moral hazard.
5. A single, openâ€‘source **FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform**â€”with eâ€‘protocol builders, liabilityâ€‘insurance bidding, blockchain custody, and AIâ€‘ranked treatment listsâ€”will enable any willing patient to join a trial of the mostâ€‘promising therapy for their condition.
6. Modernizing FDA regulation to embrace realâ€‘world evidence, remote monitoring, and validated nonâ€‘animal test methods will accelerate safe cures.

### SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.

In this Actâ€”

1. **Secretary** means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
2. **FDA** means the Food and Drug Administration.
3. **NIH** means the National Institutes of Health.
4. **Pragmatic decentralized trial** means a clinical study integrated into routine care, allowing remote or local data capture, minimal exclusions, and broad patient demographics.
5. **Mostâ€‘promising treatment** means an intervention thatâ€”(A) ranks within the top decile of projected QALY gain for a condition under SEC. 204(g)(3) or (B) holds Breakthrough Therapy or RMAT designation under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
6. **QALY** means a qualityâ€‘adjusted lifeâ€‘year, one year of life in perfect health.

## TITLE III â€” UNIVERSAL TRIAL ACCESS (RIGHTâ€‘TOâ€‘TRIAL PROGRAM)

### SEC. 301. UNIVERSAL ELIGIBILITY FOR INVESTIGATIONAL INTERVENTIONS.

(a) **Right.** Beginning 24 months after enactment, any U.S. resident with a qualifying condition who requests an investigational intervention **shall be guaranteed enrolmentâ€”remotely if necessaryâ€”in at least one pragmatic, decentralized trial arm evaluating that intervention**, provided the patient meets minimal safety criteria in subsection (c).

(b) **Sponsor Incentive.** The Secretary shall award a **transferable Priorityâ€‘Review Voucher (PRV)** under section 524A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to any sponsor that, on or before the universalâ€‘enrolment activation date, opens or amends a trial on the FDA v2 Platform to accept such patientâ€‘directed enrolment and maintains adequate investigationalâ€‘product supply. A PRV is forfeited if the sponsor later restricts patient enrolment without a documented safety or manufacturing constraint.

(c) **Safetyâ€‘Based Exclusions Only.** Sponsors or IRBs may exclude an individual patient **solely for documented, evidenceâ€‘based safety reasons** (e.g., a specific contraindication, allergy, or organâ€‘system risk) or if investigationalâ€‘product supply is demonstrably insufficient. Exclusion rationales must be transmitted to the FDA Dashboard within 7 days and are subject to FDA audit.

(d) **NIH Microâ€‘Study Fallback.** If no sponsor operates an active investigationalâ€‘newâ€‘drug application that can accept the patient within 60 days of request, the NIHâ€”using Other Transaction Authorityâ€”shall initiate a singleâ€‘arm or adaptive microâ€‘study to provide the intervention under IND and collect outcomes via the Platform; such microâ€‘studies qualify for subsidies under Â§â€¯303.

(e) **Adaptive Enrolment.** Sponsors participating under this section must accept dataâ€‘driven lowering of exclusion criteria unless an IRB documents incremental safety risk.

### SEC. 302. PATIENT PROTECTIONS, CONSENT, AND LIABILITY. PATIENT PROTECTIONS, CONSENT, AND LIABILITY.

(a) **Central IRB.** All Rightâ€‘toâ€‘Trial protocols shall undergo singleâ€‘IRB review per 45 CFR Â§â€¯46.114\[8]; FDA shall publish a master reliance agreement.
(b) **Informed Consent.** Platform eâ€‘consent shall disclose investigational nature, known/unknown risks, mandatory patient coâ€‘pay (SEC. 304), and dataâ€‘sharing terms; execution of the eâ€‘consent **constitutes both 45 CFR Â§â€¯164.508 authorization and, where applicable, a waiver of authorization under Â§â€¯164.512(i)\[11] for research use of protected health information**, as approved by the reviewing IRB; signed consent is hashed and stored on the blockchain ledger.
(c) **Safety Monitoring.** Sponsors must stream adverseâ€‘event data to the Dashboard within 24 hours; FDA may halt enrolment under 21 CFR Â§â€¯312.42.
(d) **Liability Shield.** Goodâ€‘faith compliance grants immunity from tort claims except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; mirrors Pub. L. 115â€‘176 Â§â€¯2(c).

### SEC. 303. NIH PARTICIPATION SUBSIDIES.

(a) **Fund.** A revolving Clinicalâ€‘Trial Participation Subsidy Fund is established; authorized to receive \$2 billion FY 2026â€“30.
(b) **Allocation Algorithm.** NIH shall develop, publish, and annually recompute an open optimisation model for the allocation of subsidies. This model shall aim to maximize public health value, primarily assessed by **(1) projected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per dollar of subsidy, (2) the potential for significant healthcare system cost savings, and (3) the marginal scientific value of the research, including the value of reducing uncertainty for interventions with limited existing evidence but high potential impact.** The algorithm shall be designed to dynamically incorporate new evidence on treatment efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness as it is generated through the FDA v2 Platform.
(c) **Payments.** NIH pays sponsors per enrolled participant up to the algorithmic cap; sponsors certify costs and submit outcomes.
(d) **Audit.** GAO shall audit fund disbursements biennially; clawâ€‘back for misâ€‘certified costs.

### SEC. 304. PATIENT COSTâ€‘SHARING.

(a) **Minimum Coâ€‘payment. Each participant shall pay a nonâ€‘zero fee set by the Secretary between the 25th and 75th percentile of commercialâ€‘insurance specialistâ€‘visit copays for the preceding year, **adjusted annually by the CPIâ€‘U** (initially \$15â€“\$40 per visit).** Each participant shall pay a nonâ€‘zero fee set by the Secretary between the 25th and 75th percentile of commercialâ€‘insurance specialistâ€‘visit copays for the preceding year (initially \$15â€“\$40 per visit).
(b) **Cap.** Sponsors may not bill participants beyond the statutory coâ€‘pay; NIH subsidy + sponsor absorb remaining costs.
(c) **Disclosure.** Cost schedule and coâ€‘pay displayed in eâ€‘consent; participants may terminate if costs subsequently rise.
