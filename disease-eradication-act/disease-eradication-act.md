# 💖 DISEASE ERADICATION ACT

## 📜 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS

### 1.1 📛 Title

This Act may be cited as the **"Disease Eradication Act"**.

### 1.2 🏥 Core Problems This Act Solves

Today's healthcare system is broken because:

* ⏳ **Bureaucratic delays** block life-saving treatments by 7-12 years

* 🚫 **[97% of patients](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/111/3/245/5307078)** are excluded from clinical trials for various reasons, denying access to promising treatments
* 💰 **[Drug development costs](https://csdd.tufts.edu/csddnews/2018/3/9/march-2016-tufts-csdd-rd-cost-study)** average $2.6B, which is passed on to patients in the form of higher prices
* 📈 **[80% of R&D](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-40)** focuses on super expensive drugs costing over $100k/year instead of affordable alternatives
* ⏱️ **[Terminal patients](https://www.fda.gov/media/151060/download)** wait 4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals
* 🌍 **[US approvals](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1610301)** lag 3-5 years behind Europe and Asia
* 🩺 Only **[5% of healthcare spending](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/costs/index.htm)** goes to preventive care, despite $1 spent saving $3 in future costs
