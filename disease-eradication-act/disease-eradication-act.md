# DISEASE ERADICATION ACT

## 1. PROBLEMS THIS ACT ADDRESSES

- **Excessive regulatory delays**: Life-saving treatments are held up by slow and costly processes.  
- **High development costs**: New drugs can cost billions, pricing out smaller innovators and pushing prices higher for patients.  
- **Low patient enrollment**: Less than 5% of patients participate in trials, limiting data and slowing breakthroughs.  
- **Poor incentives**: Profit-based drug development often focuses on expensive treatments instead of true cures or prevention.  
- **Limited patient rights**: Patients who want to try emerging therapies face legal and bureaucratic barriers.

## 2. PATIENT RIGHTS

1. **Freedom to Participate in Decentralized Global Trials**  
   - Any patient can join open research efforts that meet basic safety standards.  
   - Remote monitoring and digital tools ensure broad, inclusive enrollment.

2. **Access to the Most Promising Treatments**  
   - Published rankings show which treatments have the best outcomes for similar patient profiles.  
   - Patients can choose based on real-world evidence rather than guesswork.

3. **Protection from Unfair Barriers**  
   - No excessive fees, license restrictions, or bans on personal medication imports from trusted sources.  
   - Enforcement mechanisms penalize attempts to block or delay patient access.

## 3. INSTITUTIONS THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS

### 3A. DECENTRALIZED FDA (dFDA)
- **Automates Trials**  
  - Runs continuous real-world studies, replacing long, expensive phases.  
  - Collects and analyzes safety/efficacy data instantly across geographies.
- **Publishes Rankings & Outcome Labels**  
  - Maintains a transparent system showing which treatments work best for each condition and patient demographic.  
  - Uses AI to detect adverse events early and refine treatment recommendations.
- **Global Coordination**  
  - Harmonizes regulatory data from multiple countries, reducing duplicated testing.  
  - Encourages free flow of verified treatments across borders.

### 3B. DECENTRALIZED INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (dIH)
- **Retroactive Rewards for Cost-Saving Cures**  
  - Pays manufacturers 50% of the healthcare savings generated by their therapies.  
  - Focuses on outcomes verified by the dFDAâ€™s global data, replacing traditional grants.  
- **Eliminates Waste**  
  - Ends fragmented, inefficient grant programs.  
  - Channels funds directly to treatments that reduce long-term medical expenses.
- **Aligns Incentives**  
  - Encourages prevention and cures by tying rewards to actual health impact.  
  - Drives investment toward broad-impact therapies rather than marginal, high-ticket drugs.

### 3C. PATIENT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX
- **Advocacy & Oversight**  
  - A coalition of patient groups that ensures ongoing protection of patient rights and fair access.  
- **Policy Influence**  
  - Pressures lawmakers and regulators to support open access to therapies.  
  - Publicly flags any agency or organization undermining patient interests.
- **Transparency & Education**  
  - Maintains easy-to-understand guides on how to join trials and find effective treatments.  
  - Helps patients navigate global data published by the dFDA.

### FDAi Oversight System
1. AI-Powered Regulation
   - Implementation of FDAi, an autonomous AI agent for continuous monitoring and analysis
   - Real-time assessment of drug safety and efficacy
   - Predictive modeling for potential adverse effects
   - Automated preliminary review of new drug applications

## IMPLEMENTATION & IMPACT

- **Immediate Access**: Patients can try new treatments that have passed essential safety checks without waiting for years of red tape.  
- **Cost Reduction**: Developers save on trial expenses; those savings are shared with patients and passed on as lower prices.  
- **Acceleration of Cures**: By tying financial rewards to measurable cost reductions, manufacturers shift focus to real breakthroughs.  
- **Global Participation**: More patients contribute data, leading to quicker identification of effective therapies and faster eradication of diseases.  
- **Stronger Patient Rights**: The Patient Industrial Complex enforces transparency and prevents backsliding into restrictive policies.

### Patient Governance Rights
1. Patient Representative Boards
   - Each major institution shall maintain a Patient Representative Board comprising at least 40% patients or patient advocates
   - Board members shall have voting rights on major policy decisions, treatment protocols, and resource allocation
   - Regular public forums must be held to gather patient input

2. Transparency Requirements
   - Institutions must publish quarterly reports on treatment outcomes, costs, and policy impacts
   - All major policy decisions must undergo a public comment period
