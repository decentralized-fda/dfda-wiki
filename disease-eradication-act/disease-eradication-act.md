# üöÄ RIGHT TO TRIAL & FDA UPGRADE ACT

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE

### 1.1 Short Title

This Act may be cited as the **"Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act"**.

### 1.2 Findings

The Congress finds that:

(1) The current healthcare and medical research system suffers from critical inefficiencies and inequities:
    (a) ‚è≥ **Bureaucratic and Regulatory Delays:** Life-saving treatments are often delayed by 7-12 years from discovery to patient access.
    (b) üö´ **Exclusion from Clinical Trials:** Approximately [97% of patients](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/111/3/245/5307078) (and [85% by other estimates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985)) are excluded from or unable to participate in clinical trials, denying access to potentially life-saving investigational treatments and limiting the generalizability of trial results.
    (c) üí∞ **Excessive Drug Development Costs:** The average cost to develop a new treatment is approximately [$2.6 billion](https://csdd.tufts.edu/csddnews/2018/3/9/march-2016-tufts-csdd-rd-cost-study) (with some estimates at [$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311)), these costs are ultimately passed on to patients, insurers, and taxpayers.
    (d) üìà **Misaligned Research Incentives:** A significant portion of research and development, estimated at [80% by some sources](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-40), focuses on treatments with high profit potential rather than on those with the greatest public health impact or on affordable alternatives.
    (e) ‚è±Ô∏è **Prolonged Waits for Breakthrough Therapies:** Patients with terminal or life-altering conditions often wait [4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals](https://www.fda.gov/media/151060/download).
    (f) üåç **Delayed Access Compared to Other Nations:** Approval and availability of new treatments in the United States can [lag 3-5 years behind](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1610301) approvals in other developed nations.
    (g) üíä **Lack of Treatments for Most Diseases:** An estimated [95% of diseases](https://ncats.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NCATS_RareDiseasesFactSheet.pdf) have no FDA-approved treatment, leaving millions of patients with limited options.
    (h) üìä **Neglect of Real-World Evidence:** The current system often fails to systematically collect, analyze, and integrate real-world evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments across diverse patient populations.
    (i) üôà **Publication Bias:** Negative or inconclusive trial results are often unpublished, leading to redundant research efforts and a skewed understanding of treatment efficacy.
    (j) ü•´ **Data Scarcity on Unpatentable Interventions:** There is a significant lack of data on the long-term effects and comparative effectiveness of unpatentable interventions, including many foods, dietary patterns, and existing repurposed drugs.
    (k) üóì **Insufficient Long-Term Outcome Data:** Many clinical trials are of short duration, providing limited information on the long-term benefits and risks of treatments.

(2) Modern technology and decentralized approaches, as demonstrated by initiatives like the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/), offer the potential to dramatically accelerate medical research, reduce costs by up to 80-95%, and improve patient access to care.

(3) Patients have a fundamental interest in making informed decisions about their healthcare, including the option to participate in well-regulated clinical trials for investigational treatments when existing options are insufficient.

(4) An open, transparent, and publicly accessible platform for clinical trial data, treatment outcomes, and regulatory information can empower patients, clinicians, and researchers, fostering innovation and public trust.

### 1.3 Purpose

The purposes of this Act are‚Äî

(1) To establish and guarantee the right of eligible patients to participate in approved clinical trials for investigational treatments for their conditions, particularly when currently available treatments are ineffective or unsatisfactory.
(2) To mandate the creation, operation, and continuous improvement of "FDA.gov v2," a publicly owned, open-source, and interoperable digital platform for managing all aspects of clinical research, treatment information, and regulatory processes.
(3) To dramatically reduce the cost and time associated with clinical trials by leveraging decentralized methodologies, automation, real-world data, and the FDA.gov v2 platform.
(4) To ensure comprehensive, transparent, and unbiased collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on the safety and effectiveness of all treatments, including through standardized "Outcome Labels" and comparative effectiveness rankings.
(5) To foster a collaborative and innovative research ecosystem by making anonymized research data, tools, and platform functionalities openly available.
(6) To establish an AI-powered system, "FDAi," to support patients, researchers, and regulators by analyzing data, providing personalized insights, and enhancing regulatory oversight.
(7) To realign financial incentives to reward the development of cures, preventative interventions, and treatments that provide significant value to patients and public health.
(8) To enhance public trust in the medical research and regulatory system through radical transparency, accountability, and patient-centeredness.
