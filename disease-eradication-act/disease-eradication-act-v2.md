### SEC. 103. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

1. **Limited Patient Access:** Only about **15% of patients** are currently able to participate in clinical trials, meaning the vast majority of patients are unable to access investigational treatments or contribute their health data to research. This lack of access slows the development of new therapies and **excludes 85%** of real-world patients from contributing to medical knowledge.

2. **Lengthy Drug Development Timelines:** On average, it takes approximately **17 years** from the discovery of a new treatment for it to become widely available to patients. Such protracted timelines contribute to prolonged patient suffering and **tens of thousands of preventable deaths each decade** due to regulatory and procedural delays.

3. **High Costs and Inefficiencies:** Developing a new drug therapy can cost on the order of **\$1.6 billion** (with typical clinical trials costing tens of millions of dollars), a burden ultimately borne by patients and the healthcare system. Traditional trials incur high per-patient costs (often **tens of thousands of dollars each**), fueling drug prices and deterring research in less profitable areas. These inefficiencies waste resources and **repeat failures** – for example, negative trial results are often **never published**, leading to redundant efforts that squander billions of dollars.

4. **Unmet Medical Needs:** Over **95% of diseases have no FDA-approved treatment**. Patients with rare diseases are especially underserved, as it is nearly impossible to recoup the high development costs from small patient populations under the current model. As a result, millions of people suffer from conditions lacking effective therapies. Globally, an estimated **2 billion people** are afflicted by diseases with no cures, and an enormous number of potential treatments (on the order of **hundreds of billions** of compounds and interventions) remain **untested** in any clinical trial.

5. **Data Gaps and Lack of Transparency:** Critical gaps in clinical data persist. **Negative results** from trials often go unreported, distorting the evidence base. There is **no comprehensive system to rank treatment effectiveness** for a given condition, so patients and doctors cannot easily identify the safest and most effective therapies. Additionally, there is little research on interventions that cannot be patented (such as certain nutraceuticals or lifestyle modifications), and **long-term outcomes** for many approved drugs remain unknown because most trials are too short to capture long-term effects. These gaps impede informed decision-making and innovation.

6. **Underrepresentation and Inequity:** Traditional clinical trials often **exclude large segments** of the patient population – by design or circumstance up to **85% of real-world patients** may not meet restrictive eligibility criteria. Lack of diversity and representativeness in trials undermines the generalizability of results and fails to address health disparities.

7. **Opportunities for Improvement:** Advances in technology and trial design provide an opportunity to dramatically improve this situation. **Pragmatic decentralized trials** – integrated into routine clinical care and using digital health tools – have proven capable of rapid, cost-efficient results. Notably, the United Kingdom’s RECOVERY trial in 2020 enrolled over 49,000 patients in a nationwide pragmatic study, delivering actionable results in under 100 days and **reducing cost per patient to roughly \$500** (versus \~\$41,000 in traditional trials). This trial alone saved **hundreds of thousands of lives** by quickly identifying an effective treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrating the life-saving potential of accelerated, large-scale clinical research.

8. **Necessity of Modernization:** In order to **eradicate diseases and accelerate medical progress**, it is necessary to modernize the drug development process. By empowering patients with a right to participate in research, leveraging real-world evidence, ensuring transparency of data, and utilizing modern digital infrastructure, we can **dramatically reduce trial costs and timelines**, encourage innovation for neglected conditions, and bring effective treatments to patients faster. Congress therefore recognizes the urgent need for a new framework that guarantees patient access to clinical trials and updates the regulatory infrastructure for the 21st century.

### SEC. 104. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

1. **FDA v2 Platform; Platform** – The term “**FDA v2 Platform**” or “**Platform**” means the integrated digital trial platform established pursuant to section 201, which modernizes the Food and Drug Administration’s clinical trial capabilities. The Platform is an online, interoperable system to facilitate decentralized clinical trials, real-time data collection, and broad patient participation in accordance with this Act.

2. **Pragmatic Clinical Trial** – The term “**pragmatic clinical trial**” means a clinical trial primarily designed to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of an intervention in a **real-world health care setting** and diverse patient population. Such trials are generally integrated into routine clinical practice (often using existing care infrastructure and data collection from electronic health records or patient devices) and focus on outcomes relevant to patients and practitioners. Pragmatic trials under this Act are conducted with appropriate human-subject protections and Institutional Review Board oversight, but employ **flexible protocols** to reflect broader clinical practice rather than narrow experimental conditions.

3. **Decentralized Clinical Trial** – The term “**decentralized clinical trial**” means a clinical study in which **some or all trial-related activities occur at locations other than traditional centralized trial sites**. This includes trials that utilize telemedicine, local healthcare providers, home visits, or digital health technologies to allow participants to partake remotely or in their own communities. Decentralized trials often rely on electronic data capture (from wearables, remote monitoring, etc.) and direct-to-patient investigational product distribution, thereby reducing the need for participants to travel to centralized sites.

4. **Institutional Review Board; IRB** – The term “**Institutional Review Board**” or “**IRB**” means a committee or board, formally designated in accordance with applicable federal regulations, that reviews and monitors biomedical research involving human subjects to ensure protection of participants’ rights and welfare. An IRB must approve a clinical trial protocol before patient enrollment under this Act, consistent with requirements of 21 C.F.R. Part 56 and/or 45 C.F.R. Part 46 as applicable.

5. **Trial Sponsor** – The term “**trial sponsor**” means any person, company, academic institution, government agency, or other organization that takes responsibility for the initiation, management, and financing of a clinical trial. This term includes pharmaceutical manufacturers, biotech companies, academic research centers, non-profit research entities, or consortia of such parties. A **research partner** or **trial sponsor** under this Act may also refer to a principal investigator or lead institution for a given study, as context requires.

6. **Eligible Patient** – The term “**eligible patient**” means an individual who (A) has been diagnosed with, or is at risk for, a disease or condition under investigation, and (B) meets the inclusion criteria of an IRB-approved clinical trial available on the Platform (taking into account pragmatic design with broad eligibility). An eligible patient must provide informed consent to join a trial and may be required to meet basic safety criteria set by the protocol, but **shall not be disqualified solely due to age, disability, geographic location, or inability to travel** if those factors do not directly relate to the trial’s medical criteria. For purposes of the Right established in section 105, a patient who meets the trial criteria and consents shall be considered eligible.

7. **Health-Savings Sharing Program** – The term “**Health-Savings Sharing Program**” refers to the optional incentive program established under section 402, in which a portion of demonstrated health care cost savings (for example, reductions in hospitalization costs or other medical expenditures) attributable to a new treatment or trial methodology is **shared (50/50)** between the sponsoring entity (or other innovators) and the federal government or health insurers. This program is intended to reward innovations – including new uses of unpatentable therapies or more efficient trial designs – that significantly lower healthcare spending while improving patient outcomes.

8. **Secretary** – The term “**Secretary**” means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Except as otherwise specified, any authority or requirement of the Secretary under this Act may be carried out by the Secretary directly or by the Secretary’s designee, including the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA Commissioner) acting under delegated authority.

9. **Other Definitions** – Terms not specifically defined in this Act shall, as applicable, have the meaning given to them in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) or the Public Health Service Act, or if not defined in those statutes, their ordinary meaning with regard to clinical research and healthcare.

### SEC. 105. RIGHT TO ENROLL IN PRAGMATIC CLINICAL TRIALS.

(a) **Right Established.—** Every patient suffering from a disease or health condition shall have the right to **enroll in an IRB-approved pragmatic clinical trial** for that condition, subject to the provisions of this section. This “Right to Trial” is established as a statutory right for patients to access investigational therapies through participation in clinical research, in addition to any other available pathways. The exercise of this right is subject to the following principles:

1. **Availability of Trials:** The Secretary shall ensure that a robust platform of pragmatic clinical trials is available for **all common diseases and as many rare diseases as feasible**, so that no patient who wishes to participate in a clinical trial is left without an option. It is the intent of Congress that through the FDA v2 Platform (established in Title II) and related efforts, clinical trial opportunities will exist for **100% of patients** who seek them. In furtherance of this goal, trial protocols may be **adaptive and inclusive**, grouping patients by broad condition categories or trial master protocols to cover multiple interventions, thereby maximizing coverage of patient needs.

2. **Non-Discrimination:** A trial sponsor or investigator **shall not exclude any eligible patient** who wishes to enroll in a trial under this Act **except** for reasons of patient safety or scientific integrity as approved by an IRB. Criteria that have historically led to exclusion of large patient groups (such as age, comorbid conditions, or distance from trial sites) should be minimized in pragmatic trials. Any exclusion that is not scientifically justified (or required for ethical/safety reasons) is contrary to the intent of this Act. All patients, including those from underrepresented populations, shall have fair access to enrollment.

3. **Enrollment Process:** The FDA v2 Platform shall provide a centralized mechanism for patients to exercise this right easily. Patients may search for trials related to their condition and **enroll electronically** through the Platform (as described in section 202). Enrollment shall be accomplished with appropriate informed consent (as detailed in section 106) and verification that the patient meets the trial’s inclusion criteria. For decentralized pragmatic trials, **geographic location shall not be a barrier** – patients can participate remotely or through local providers as the protocol allows.

4. **Concurrent Standard of Care:** Enrollment in a pragmatic trial under this right **shall not require a patient to forgo or delay standard medical care** for their condition. Trials conducted under this Act should whenever possible be designed to integrate with routine care, meaning patients continue to receive the current standard therapy (if any) and are either supplemented with or randomized to investigational interventions in a manner that does not deprive them of known effective treatment. Nothing in this Act requires a patient to abandon or replace standard care with a trial – the right is to **augment** their care with trial participation if they so choose.

5. **Global Participation:** The Right to Trial is not limited by U.S. geography. Patients located outside the United States may also participate in trials via the FDA v2 Platform (in accordance with applicable international arrangements and local IRB approvals), and U.S. patients may enroll in trials regardless of state or country, so long as the trial is conducted under this Act’s standards. The Secretary shall coordinate with international health authorities to encourage global decentralized trials, recognizing that disease eradication and medical progress are global endeavors.

(b) **Legal Effect.—** The right established by this section creates an entitlement for patients to seek enrollment in clinical trials but **does not obligate any patient** to participate. Exercise of the right to enroll is voluntary and based on informed consent. This section also does not guarantee that a particular trial will yield therapeutic benefit for the patient – it guarantees **access to the opportunity**. Patients should be advised that investigational treatments carry uncertainties. However, **no federal, state, or local law or regulation may prohibit or limit a patient’s exercise of the right to enroll in an IRB-approved clinical trial** pursuant to this Act, and any such barrier is preempted by this federal law. Patients shall not be penalized by insurers or employers for choosing to participate in clinical research under this Act.

(c) **Expansion of Existing Programs.—** The Right to Trial established here is intended to complement and expand existing FDA programs, not replace them. It shall be **in addition to** the FDA’s “Expanded Access” (compassionate use) program and any federal Right-to-Try provisions. Patients eligible under those pathways remain free to choose those routes. This Act focuses on participation in **structured trials** (with data collection) as a means to both access treatment and contribute to generalizable knowledge. The Secretary shall harmonize implementation of this right with existing programs to ensure clarity for patients and health care providers.

### SEC. 106. INFORMED CONSENT AND PATIENT SAFEGUARDS.

(a) **Informed Consent Standards.—** No patient may be enrolled in a clinical trial under this Act without providing informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 C.F.R. Part 50 (or, for trials under the Common Rule, 45 C.F.R. Part 46) or any successor regulations. The FDA v2 Platform shall include user-friendly electronic informed consent interfaces that **clearly explain the trial** in plain language – including its purpose, procedures, potential risks, potential benefits, and the voluntary nature of participation. Special attention shall be given to ensuring patients understand that they may withdraw at any time without penalty. Consent materials should be available in multiple languages and accessible formats. When minors or decisionally impaired individuals are involved, consent (and assent where applicable) must be obtained from a legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable laws, with additional protections as required.

(b) **Ethical Oversight (IRBs).—** All trials conducted under this Act must have IRB approval and continuing oversight. The Secretary shall facilitate the use of **centralized IRBs** or reciprocal IRB agreements to streamline multi-site and remote trials. An IRB reviewing a pragmatic decentralized trial must ensure that the trial’s design adequately protects participants – for example, through appropriate monitoring for adverse events, data safety monitoring plans, and privacy protections (see Title III for data safeguards). The IRB must also ensure that inclusion/exclusion criteria are justified. Protocols should generally be designed to **minimize risks** to participants and employ safety net rules (such as early stopping for harm or modification of dose) as appropriate. The Secretary, through the Office for Human Research Protections and FDA, shall issue guidance to IRBs specific to pragmatic and decentralized trials to assist in consistent application of ethical standards in this new context.

(c) **Patient Safety and Medical Oversight.—** Participants in trials under this Act are entitled to the **same level of care and safety monitoring** as in any clinical trial. Whenever a patient is receiving an investigational drug or intervention as part of a trial, a qualified physician or appropriately licensed health professional must be responsible for that patient’s study-related medical care. Decentralized trials can meet this requirement via local physicians, telemedicine oversight, or other innovative models, but in all cases participants must have access to medical consultation and care. Any serious adverse events must be reported promptly through the Platform to the sponsor, IRB, and FDA as required by regulation. The Secretary shall ensure that clear channels exist for patients to report concerns or side effects and to receive guidance during a trial.

(d) **Continuation and Standard of Care Post-Trial.—** If a trial under this Act demonstrates that an investigational treatment is effective, sponsors are encouraged to facilitate continued access to that treatment for patients who benefited, until such time as it may become commercially available. Conversely, if an investigational treatment is found ineffective or unsafe, participants should be transitioned off it safely, with appropriate medical guidance. In all cases, patients retain the right to **concurrent standard of care** (as noted in Sec. 105(a)(4)) and to withdraw from the trial at any time. No trial protocol under this Act may employ “placebo alone” control in situations where an effective standard therapy exists, unless withholding such therapy is ethically and scientifically justified and explicitly approved by an IRB with patient consent.

(e) **Privacy and Data Security.—** Patient privacy shall be strictly protected. Individually identifiable health data collected in trials must be secured in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other applicable privacy laws. Section 302 of this Act provides for de-identified data sharing for transparency, but any disclosure of trial data must remove personal identifiers in accordance with HIPAA de-identification standards or obtain explicit additional consent from the patient for sharing identifiable information. The Platform shall incorporate state-of-the-art cybersecurity and encryption to safeguard patient information (see section 301 for technical standards). Patients should retain ultimate control over their personal health records – for instance, the **Digital Twin Safe** feature of the Platform (referenced in section 202) will allow patients to store and manage their own health data and specify with whom it is shared.

### SEC. 107. LIABILITY PROTECTIONS.

(a) **Liability Shield for Participation.—** No manufacturer, sponsor, clinical investigator, health care provider, or institution shall be liable in any civil action for any **injury, death, or loss** to a patient resulting from the patient’s participation in a clinical trial under this Act, provided that the trial was conducted in accordance with the requirements of this Act, the investigational product was administered or used as part of the trial protocol, and there was **no gross negligence or willful misconduct** by the party seeking protection. This liability immunity is intended to ensure that fear of lawsuits does not deter sponsors or doctors from enabling patient access to investigational treatments through trials. The immunity provided by this subsection shall be construed in parity with the immunity provisions of the federal Right-to-Try Act and FDA expanded access (compassionate use) program, extending comparable protections to the context of pragmatic trials.

(b) **No Liability for Declining Participation.—** Likewise, no sponsor or health care provider shall be liable for **declining to offer or provide an investigational treatment** under this Act, or for a decision to terminate a trial or a patient’s participation, so long as such decisions are made in good faith for legitimate reasons (such as interim data indicating lack of efficacy or safety concerns, or the sponsor’s inability to provide continued drug supply). Patients have the right to seek trial enrollment, but this Act does not mandate that a particular sponsor initiate or continue a trial beyond what is feasible or ethical. This subsection ensures that parties are not compelled by fear of litigation to initiate or continue trials inappropriately.

(c) **Preservation of Governmental Oversight and Remedies.—** The liability protections in this section do **not** limit the federal government’s ability to enforce regulations or prosecute fraud. For example, if a sponsor knowingly violates FDA regulations or falsifies data, the appropriate enforcement actions (civil or criminal) may still be taken by the government. Additionally, this section does not waive liability for **willful misconduct, gross negligence, or violation of the protocol** that harms patients – those remain grounds for legal action. It simply provides a safe harbor for parties acting in good faith within the structure of approved trials. Participants in trials under this Act retain whatever rights to compensation may be available under other laws or the trial’s policies (e.g., if an injury occurs, some sponsors or state laws provide compensation; this Act does not nullify such obligations except to the extent of shielding from tort claims as described).

(d) **Product Approval Implications.—** The Secretary shall not consider adverse outcomes that occur in the context of a Right-to-Trial participation **as negative evidence against product approval**, except to the extent that such outcomes are relevant to safety and efficacy in a scientifically valid manner. In other words, data from expanded participation trials should be used to inform regulatory decisions, but a manufacturer’s good-faith participation in this program (which might include very sick patients or broader populations) should not unfairly prejudice the FDA’s evaluation of the product. The FDA may choose to **exclude or contextualize** data from certain pragmatic-use cohorts in its analysis to ensure that conclusions are scientifically sound. This provision is intended to encourage sponsors to open trials to more patients without fear that unusual cases will jeopardize approval. All such data must still be reported and publicly disseminated per Title III, maintaining transparency while allowing regulatory flexibility in analysis.

(e) **Insurance and Compensation Clarification.—** This Act does not preempt any arrangements regarding insurance coverage or compensation for trial-related injuries. Patients and sponsors remain free to enter agreements (or be subject to state laws) regarding who bears the costs of medical care if injury occurs. Sponsors are strongly encouraged to **provide treatment free of charge** to trial participants and to cover the costs of medical care for trial-related injuries, consistent with ethical guidelines, but this Act stops short of mandating specific compensation. However, the Secretary shall study and report on the feasibility of a **“Clinical Trial Injury Compensation Fund”** for pragmatic trials, which could further enhance patient protection without chilling participation by sponsors (such a fund could be supported by a small levy on federally funded trials or other mechanisms). The findings of such study shall be reported to Congress within 2 years of enactment.

## TITLE II—FDA MODERNIZATION AND DECENTRALIZED TRIALS PLATFORM

### SEC. 201. ESTABLISHMENT OF FDA V2 PLATFORM.

(a) **In General.—** The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall establish and implement an upgraded clinical trial infrastructure, referred to as the **“FDA v2 Platform”** (or simply “the Platform”). The FDA v2 Platform shall be a secure, internet-based system to **modernize and digitize the drug and device development process**, with the goal of accelerating safe and effective therapies to patients. The Platform will serve as the technological and organizational foundation for the initiatives in this Act, enabling global **decentralized clinical trials**, continuous real-world data collection, and open collaboration among stakeholders.

(b) **Timeline and Implementation.—** The Secretary shall initiate development of the Platform immediately upon enactment of this Act. **Not later than 12 months** after enactment, the Secretary shall launch an operational prototype of the Platform with core functionality (patient enrollment, data capture, etc.), and **not later than 24 months** after enactment, the Platform shall be fully implemented for use in multi-center pragmatic trials as described in section 202. The Secretary may execute this development through contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements with technology vendors, research organizations, or other qualified entities, and shall ensure that the Platform’s development is done in an **open and transparent** manner (including the release of open-source software components where practicable).

(c) **Integration with FDA Operations.—** The FDA v2 Platform shall be integrated into the Food and Drug Administration’s existing regulatory processes. This includes: (1) linking the Platform with the FDA’s investigational new drug (IND) and investigational device exemption (IDE) systems so that trials conducted via the Platform are properly authorized and in compliance with 21 C.F.R. parts 312 and 812 (except as modified by this Act or subsequent regulations to accommodate pragmatic trial designs); (2) coordinating with ClinicalTrials.gov (the federal clinical trial registry and results database) to **avoid duplication** of registration and reporting – the Platform may serve as an alternate or enhanced registration mechanism for trials under this Act, provided data is transferred to ClinicalTrials.gov or a successor registry for public access as required; and (3) training FDA staff in the use of real-time data dashboards and analytic tools provided by the Platform, so that regulatory reviewers can efficiently monitor ongoing studies and incorporate real-world evidence into decision-making.

(d) **Collaboration with Other Agencies and Partners.—** In establishing the Platform, the Secretary shall collaborate with other federal agencies that hold relevant health data or oversee research, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), and the Department of Veterans Affairs, among others. The goal is to leverage existing data standards, health information exchanges, and research networks (such as the PCORnet or NIH Collaboratory) to populate and enhance the Platform. The Secretary is also authorized to collaborate with **international regulatory authorities** to facilitate globally harmonized trials; where feasible, data from the Platform should meet requirements of other major regulatory agencies (such as EMA in Europe) to allow mutual recognition of results.

(e) **Regulatory Flexibility for Platform Trials.—** The Secretary shall exercise existing authority, and promulgate new regulations if necessary, to provide appropriate regulatory flexibility for trials conducted on the FDA v2 Platform. This may include adaptive trial designs, master protocols covering multiple therapies, the use of interim analyses for quick regulatory feedback, and acceptance of **real-world data** collected via the Platform as evidence for approvals. The intent is to evolve beyond the traditional Phase 1–2–3 sequential trial paradigm, toward a more **continuous evidence development model** that the Platform enables. Any such flexibility must continue to ensure patient safety and scientific rigor, but the Secretary is specifically authorized to waive or modify regulatory requirements that are shown to be **unnecessary impediments** in the context of pragmatic platform trials (for example, allowing remote informed consent in lieu of in-person consent, or simplifying IND safety reporting for certain low-risk interventions). Within 18 months of enactment, the Secretary shall issue guidance on how sponsors can utilize the Platform to satisfy FDA regulatory requirements in novel ways.

(f) **Governance and Accountability.—** The FDA v2 Platform shall be managed by an office or center designated by the Secretary (which may be a new office within FDA or an interagency team) with the mission of **80×ing medical progress** as described in the findings. An advisory committee – the **“Decentralized Trials Advisory Committee”** – shall be established, composed of patients, clinicians, industry representatives, academic researchers, data security experts, and ethicists, to advise the Secretary on the ongoing development and operation of the Platform. This committee will hold public meetings at least twice a year to review progress, solicit stakeholder input, and recommend improvements. The Secretary shall report annually to Congress on the status of the Platform, including statistics on trial participation (e.g. number of patients enrolled via the Platform, diversity metrics), average trial duration and cost, and any **disease breakthroughs** attributable to the Platform’s use.

### SEC. 202. FDA V2 PLATFORM FUNCTIONS AND CAPABILITIES.

The FDA v2 Platform established under section 201 shall have, at a minimum, the following functions and capabilities to serve **both patients and trial sponsors/researchers** in advancing clinical research:

**(a) Patient Engagement and Participation Tools.—** The Platform shall empower patients with user-friendly tools to learn about research opportunities, enroll in trials, and contribute data effortlessly:

1. **Condition Navigation and Treatment Ranking:** Patients can input or select their health condition(s) and immediately **view a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments** or clinical trial options for that condition, based on the **entire universe of available clinical and real-world evidence**. This feature will function as a continuously updated decision aid (often referred to as a “living treatment leaderboard”), synthesizing data from completed trials, observational studies, and patient-reported outcomes. Treatments (including off-label uses, generics, and lifestyle interventions) will be ranked by comparative effectiveness and safety. The ranking algorithm and data sources shall be transparent, and the Platform should present links to underlying study data (from Section 303’s publication requirements) so patients and clinicians can delve into the evidence. This empowers patients to make informed choices about which investigational therapy or trial arm they might consider.

2. **Instant Trial Enrollment from Home:** The Platform shall enable patients to **instantly enroll in decentralized clinical trials from their home** or any location. This includes an online screening module to determine eligibility, integrated e-consent as described in Sec. 106, and randomization (if applicable) handled by the system. Upon enrollment, the Platform coordinates scheduling of any required baseline tests or shipment of investigational product. **Geographical barriers are eliminated** – for example, if a trial requires lab tests, the Platform can arrange for sample collection at a local clinic or via a home nursing visit; if a trial involves a drug, it can be delivered to the patient’s local pharmacy or home. By removing traditional site limitations, the Platform allows **100% of interested patients to participate** in trials, achieving the Act’s inclusion goals.

3. **Digital Delivery of Treatments and Monitoring:** For trials requiring administration of a drug or therapy, the Platform shall integrate with pharmacies, mail-order services, or healthcare providers to **deliver the investigational treatment** to the patient in a safe and timely manner. It will also facilitate scheduling of any in-person procedures at facilities convenient to the participant. The system will generate personalized **“trial calendars”** for each participant, with reminders for medication dosing, virtual study visits, or tests. Moreover, the Platform will incorporate telemedicine capabilities (secure video consultations) so that trial investigators or nurses can remotely monitor patient status, answer questions, and ensure protocol adherence without requiring travel.

4. **Effortless Outcome Reporting:** The Platform shall provide multiple, convenient avenues for patients to **report their health outcomes, side effects, and experiences in real time**. This includes web-based surveys, mobile application notifications, integration with patients’ electronic health records (to pull clinical labs or doctor visit data automatically), and even automated phone calls or text messaging for those less comfortable with technology. The goal is to minimize patient burden in providing data – for instance, wearable devices and smartphone sensors might passively collect vital signs or activity levels. All patient-reported data will be time-stamped and securely transmitted to the central trial database. The Platform will use **standardized outcome measures and terminologies** where possible (for example, PROMIS scales for patient-reported outcomes, standardized adverse event terms) to facilitate aggregation and analysis across studies.

5. **Personalized Data Feedback (Digital Twin and FDAi Agent):** Each patient using the Platform shall have access to their **personal health data hub** (sometimes termed a “Digital Twin Safe”), which securely stores all data they contribute and relevant portions of their medical history in one place. Patients will have control over this data – they can see how their data is being used, and they can choose to share or revoke access to it beyond the trial (for example, sharing with their personal doctor or downloading for their records). Building on this, the Platform will offer each patient an **“FDAi” – an AI-driven virtual health assistant**. This FDAi agent can analyze the patient’s personal data (with permission) and the broader database to provide real-time decision support and health insights. For instance, the agent might alert a patient if an abnormal lab result comes back, or if interim trial findings suggest a certain therapy is particularly beneficial for sub-patients like them. It might also answer patient questions about the trial or their condition, drawing on the knowledge base of aggregated evidence. The FDAi agent is meant to function as a *free, personalized “super-intelligent doctor” companion*, helping patients navigate their care and trial participation. All such AI recommendations will be evidence-backed and subject to medical oversight as needed.

6. **Accessibility and Support:** The Platform must be accessible to patients of varying abilities and tech literacy. This means a responsive design (available via web, mobile app, etc.), compatibility with screen readers for the visually impaired, multilingual support, and availability of live help (e.g., a helpdesk chat or phone line) to assist patients in enrollment or troubleshooting. Special accommodations (such as simplified interfaces or community health worker intermediaries) should be considered to reach elderly patients or those without internet – including potential integration with local clinics, libraries, or pharmacies where patients can be guided through enrollment. The overarching goal is **no patient left behind** due to technical barriers.

**(b) Researcher and Trial Sponsor Functions.—** The Platform shall provide comprehensive tools for sponsors (pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms, academic researchers, and others) and their research partners to design, launch, and manage clinical trials more efficiently and at lower cost:

1. **Online Trial Design & Submission:** Sponsors will have access to a secure portal to **design trial protocols online**. Through a step-by-step interface, a sponsor can define the trial’s objectives, patient population, interventions (including dosing regimens or device usage), and outcome measures. The Platform will include libraries of best-practice **template protocols** for common trial types and adaptive designs, which sponsors can adapt to their needs. Once the design is completed, the sponsor can **submit the protocol for IRB review and FDA regulatory submission** electronically via the Platform. This submission process will be streamlined – the same digital protocol document can be routed simultaneously (as appropriate) to a designated IRB (or central IRB) and to FDA (for IND or IDE clearance). Sponsors will be able to track the status of these reviews in real time. The Platform may incorporate tools to check protocol completeness and compliance (e.g., ensuring required safety monitoring is included) before submission, potentially using AI assistance to highlight any issues.

2. **IRB Integration and Approval Workflow:** The Platform shall integrate an **IRB management system** that dramatically reduces the time and cost of ethical reviews. Sponsors can choose from participating accredited IRBs that have partnered with the Platform (or use their own IRB if integrated). IRBs on the Platform will receive protocol submissions digitally, conduct reviews via teleconference as needed, and issue approval or requests for modification through the system. Version control ensures the latest protocol and consent forms are being reviewed. Importantly, **amendments to protocols can be handled rapidly**: if a sponsor needs to adjust a trial based on interim data or any logistical change, submitting an amendment through the Platform will alert the IRB and (once approved) automatically update the **live trial protocol** for all sites/patients. By centralizing and automating much of the paperwork, the Platform targets a steep reduction in IRB processing costs (on the order of a few thousand dollars per review vs. hundreds of thousands traditionally) and near-elimination of separate IRB amendment fees. The system will maintain audit trails and ensure compliance with IRB documentation requirements for regulatory purposes.

3. **Participant Recruitment and Matching:** Trial sponsors will be aided by powerful recruitment tools. The Platform can query its user base and health records to **identify potential eligible participants** for a given trial. For example, a sponsor designing a trial for a certain cancer can see (in aggregate) how many patients in the system have that cancer and meet key criteria (without initially revealing identities, preserving privacy until patients opt in). Once a trial is approved to launch, the Platform can send notifications to patients with the relevant condition, or list the trial in patients’ treatment ranking results. The **opt-in rate** and interest can be tracked via dashboards. The recruitment function will also connect with external data sources (like disease registries, EHR databases, and patient advocacy networks) via open APIs, to broaden the reach. By leveraging **health IT interoperability**, the Platform can pre-screen large populations to find matches, reducing recruitment time and cost dramatically. Sponsors can monitor recruitment in real time and adjust strategies (or eligibility criteria, with IRB approval) if enrollment is slower than expected. This real-time feedback loop aims to reach full enrollment for trials in a fraction of traditional times.

4. **Electronic Data Capture & EHR Integration:** The FDA v2 Platform will serve as the **central data repository** for all trial data. It will ingest data from multiple sources: patient-reported outcomes (as described in part (a)(4)), **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** of participants (through health information exchange standards like HL7 FHIR APIs), laboratory systems, imaging systems, and wearable or home sensors. Sponsors will benefit from not having to set up separate data infrastructure – the Platform provides a validated, 21 CFR Part 11-compliant system for electronic data capture (EDC). Data will be stored in a standardized format using common data models (such as OMOP or CDISC CDASH) to facilitate analysis. **Manual data entry is minimized or eliminated**; for instance, rather than research staff transcribing data, the Platform can pull lab results or medication lists directly from EHRs with patient consent. This reduces errors and Source Data Verification costs by an estimated >90%. The Platform’s data module will include automated **data validation rules** and quality checks (flagging out-of-range values, duplicate entries, etc.), as well as real-time integration of **digital health technologies** (e.g. continuous glucose monitors streaming data). All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

5. **Live Analytics and Monitoring Dashboards:** Sponsors and investigators will have access to secure **dashboard interfaces** to monitor their trials in real time. These dashboards will display recruitment numbers, demographics of enrolled subjects, data capture status, and safety signals (such as number of adverse events reported). Crucially, the Platform can perform **real-time analysis** of incoming data using built-in statistical tools or AI algorithms. Sponsors might see live summaries of outcomes (blinded as necessary to preserve trial integrity) or utilize adaptive trial features: for instance, if one arm of the trial is performing significantly better, the platform’s adaptive randomization engine could start assigning more patients to that arm, after IRB concurrence, to expedite results. The dashboards also allow sponsors to fulfill FDA **safety reporting** obligations: if a serious adverse event occurs, it will be highlighted, and the sponsor can electronically submit required reports to regulators through the Platform. The FDA and IRBs can be granted appropriate access to these dashboards for oversight. This transparency, with **up-to-the-minute data**, enables rapid detection of issues and potentially faster trial conclusions if outcomes become clear early.

6. **Automation via Smart Contracts:** To reduce administrative burden, the Platform will incorporate automation technologies. Where appropriate, **blockchain-based smart contracts** or similar secure automated workflows will handle key trial processes. For example, when a patient enrolls and completes a visit, a smart contract could automatically trigger a **payment** to the patient or their health provider (if compensation is provided for time/expenses) – ensuring timely and transparent financial transactions. Smart contracts might also manage the randomization sequence to ensure allocation concealment (the code can prove that assignments were random and tamper-proof), as well as verify data integrity (by timestamping data entries on a ledger). The Platform’s use of these technologies should improve trust: all stakeholders can have confidence that processes like enrollment caps, treatment assignments, or outcome assessments are executed fairly and that data is **immutable** once recorded. The Secretary is encouraged to explore and implement these emerging technologies to the extent they enhance **efficiency, trust, and fairness** in trial conduct. However, use of such technology must comply with privacy and security standards – e.g., patient identities would not be recorded on any public ledger.

7. **Collaboration and Open Science Features:** The Platform shall foster a spirit of **collaborative research** and avoid duplication of efforts. Sponsors and researchers will have the option to run **“mega-studies”** or collaborative trials across multiple institutions globally. The Platform will support features like: multi-sponsor contribution (several companies testing their respective drugs in one master protocol), adaptive arms (adding new treatment arms as new ideas emerge), and data pooling for meta-analyses. It will maintain a public **“Wikipedia-like” knowledge base** where results from all trials are aggregated, showing the likely effects of every intervention on various conditions. This knowledge base is continuously updated as new data comes in (see Title III for publication requirements). Sponsors can also choose to share anonymized datasets with outside researchers through the Platform’s APIs, enabling independent secondary analysis (which can enhance validity and spark innovation). The **open API** (application programming interface) mandated by section 301 will allow external developers to build novel applications on top of Platform data – for example, a university team might develop a better algorithm for detecting safety signals, which could plug into the Platform. All such collaborations will occur under governance rules to protect participant privacy and intellectual property, but the default is to promote **open science** and avoid siloing of trial results.

8. **Quality Control and Compliance:** The Platform will include integrated compliance checks to help sponsors adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and regulatory requirements. For instance, audit trails will log any changes to data; electronic signatures will be used for approvals; and the system can remind investigators of pending tasks (like obtaining continuing review from IRB or renewing an IND annually). Monitoring of sites (insofar as sites still exist in decentralized trials) can be done remotely by granting monitors access to relevant records in read-only format, greatly reducing the need for on-site monitoring visits (which constitute a large cost in traditional trials). The Platform can also compile **regulatory submission packages** (e.g., if a sponsor wants to file for FDA approval, the system can output the dataset and analyses in a format suitable for submission). By centralizing these activities, the Platform ensures that even smaller companies or research groups can run trials **efficiently and in compliance** without needing extensive infrastructure of their own.

**(c) Public Transparency and Knowledge Dissemination.—** In addition to serving patients and researchers, the FDA v2 Platform shall act as a public resource for trustworthy information on clinical outcomes:

1. **Public Dashboard:** The Secretary shall ensure that the Platform provides a **public-facing dashboard** or portal where anyone (patients, clinicians, policymakers) can view aggregated, de-identified data about ongoing and completed trials. This includes statistics like number of trials underway, total participants enrolled, demographic breakdown of participants (to the extent that does not risk re-identification of individuals), and summaries of results or interim findings. For example, if several trials are in progress for a certain disease, the public dashboard might show how many people have joined, what therapies are being tested, and when results are expected. For completed trials, the dashboard will display the outcomes (e.g., “Drug X resulted in 60% improvement in symptoms vs 30% in control, p<0.01”) along with links to fuller reports or publications. These dashboards must be updated **in near real-time** as data comes in, providing unprecedented transparency in clinical research and maintaining public trust.

2. **Real-Time Data Publication:** Consistent with Title III, the Platform will support **real-time publication** of clinical data. This means that, to the extent feasible and ethical, de-identified datasets and preliminary analyses might be made public on an ongoing basis rather than waiting for a trial’s end. For example, the Platform could publish a live graph of aggregate outcome measures (blinded appropriately) or share datasets through an open API for citizen-scientists to explore. The intent is to invert the paradigm of secretive trials – instead embracing **“open science”** so that knowledge spreads quickly and duplication is reduced. At minimum, **all results (positive or negative) must be posted** on the Platform when a trial completes, and any decision to halt a trial early for futility or harm should be publicly noted to inform others. The Secretary may allow certain data to remain internal (e.g., if revealing interim efficacy data could compromise trial integrity or intellectual property) until appropriate milestones, but the bias toward transparency is clear: **negative findings will no longer be buried** and collective learning will be accelerated.

3. **Interoperability and Standards:** The Platform shall adhere to and incorporate prevailing **interoperability standards** in health IT. This includes using standardized data formats for health information (such as HL7 FHIR for exchanging data with EHRs and ISO/IEC standards for data security) and standardized vocabularies for clinical terms (SNOMED CT, LOINC, MedDRA, etc.). By using common standards, the Platform ensures that it can easily integrate with other systems – for instance, data from the Platform could populate an electronic health record or vice versa – and that external tools can interpret the data. The open APIs (see Title III) will be built on these standards so external software can reliably query the Platform. Furthermore, the Platform’s design and operations should align with initiatives like ONC’s interoperability rules and FDA’s own real-world evidence framework, ensuring it complements broader health information infrastructure.

4. **Global Access to Knowledge:** Recognizing the global nature of disease, the Platform’s public resources should be accessible worldwide. The knowledge base of treatment rankings and the wiki of study results should be made available in multiple languages, and in formats (including downloadable datasets) that researchers around the world can utilize. The Secretary may collaborate with the World Health Organization or other international bodies to share the Platform’s data and insights, thereby helping other countries to also accelerate approvals of effective therapies. By serving as a **global open repository** of clinical evidence, the FDA v2 Platform furthers not only U.S. public health but international health, in line with the ambition to **eradicate diseases** globally.

(d) **Continuous Improvement and Adaptability.—** The Platform’s functionality shall be continuously refined based on user feedback and technological advancements. The Secretary is authorized to make upgrades and add features without new legislation, provided they remain consistent with the purposes of this Act. For example, if new AI methodologies for analyzing trial data emerge, the Secretary can integrate those; if patients desire new features in the FDAi agent, those can be developed. A mechanism (such as a public suggestion forum or periodic surveys of users) should be in place to gather input from patients, researchers, and other stakeholders on improving the Platform. All updates should maintain compatibility with the core **data standards and interoperability** commitments, so that backward compatibility and data continuity are preserved. The Platform will effectively be an evolving ecosystem – analogous to how software services update regularly – but anchored by the statutory requirements to uphold patient rights, data transparency, and scientific integrity.

(e) **Regulatory Use of Platform Data.—** Data collected via the FDA v2 Platform, under appropriate quality controls, **shall be admissible as evidence** in regulatory submissions to the FDA. If a company conducts a trial on this Platform and the results show safety and efficacy, FDA shall consider that evidence with the same weight as if it came from a traditional trial (indeed, perhaps with greater confidence due to larger, real-world sample sizes). The FDA is encouraged to adapt its statistical review models to leverage the large datasets that pragmatic trials will generate, potentially using **bayesian or adaptive analysis techniques**. Additionally, because the Platform allows for long-term follow-up of patients (even after a trial formally ends, patients’ outcomes can be tracked through EHR data linkages), the FDA can use this information for post-market surveillance and real-world evidence of durability of effect. In sum, the Platform is not just a research tool but a regulatory tool: its outputs will feed directly into **faster approvals** for drugs and devices that demonstrate merit, and into safety actions for those that do not.

## TITLE III—DATA TRANSPARENCY AND INTEROPERABILITY

### SEC. 301. OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES AND DATA STANDARDS.

(a) **Open API Requirement.—** The FDA v2 Platform shall be built with and maintain a publicly documented **open Application Programming Interface (API)**. This API must allow authorized external systems and developers to **programmatically access data and functionality** of the Platform in real time, in a manner that does not compromise security or privacy. At a minimum, the open API should enable: retrieval of de-identified aggregate data on trial outcomes and adverse events; querying of available trials and their eligibility criteria; submission of data or integration of external data sources (for example, allowing healthcare providers’ systems to send patient outcomes to the Platform); and other interactions that promote interoperability. The API will use industry-standard protocols (such as REST/JSON or FHIR for healthcare data) and include appropriate authentication and authorization layers to ensure that only permitted access is given (with stricter controls on any patient-level data versus aggregate data).

(b) **Developer Support and Open Source:** The Secretary shall publish comprehensive **API documentation** and provide a sandbox or testing environment to encourage third-party innovation. Independent developers, healthcare IT vendors, patient advocacy groups, and scientific researchers should be empowered to create applications that interface with the Platform – for example, a mobile app tailored for a specific patient community that pulls in trial opportunities via the API, or a data analytics tool that fetches anonymized datasets for meta-analysis. To further facilitate trust and collaboration, core components of the Platform software (excluding any confidential or security-sensitive modules) should be released as **open-source software**. This allows experts to audit the code for security and bias, and the global community to contribute improvements. By embracing open-source principles, the Platform’s development can accelerate and remain transparent, much like successful open projects in other domains.

(c) **Health Data Standards Compliance:** All data exchange via the Platform’s API and internal systems shall comply with prevailing **health data standards** to maximize interoperability. This includes, but is not limited to: using the HL7 **Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)** standard for exchanging clinical data (e.g., patient demographics, lab results, vital signs); using standard codes for medications (RXNORM), diseases (ICD or SNOMED CT), and outcomes; and adhering to standards for data structure such as CDISC for clinical trial datasets. The Secretary, in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, shall ensure that the Platform stays updated with new standards or versions. If proprietary or non-standard data formats must be used in some aspect, the conversion or mapping to a standard must be provided. The end goal is that data flowing in or out of the Platform can be readily understood and integrated by other health information systems (electronic health records, claims systems, research databases) without requiring custom adaptation.

(d) **Interoperability with Electronic Health Records:** The Platform must seamlessly interoperate with electronic health record (EHR) systems, as these are critical sources of patient data. Pursuant to ONC’s interoperability rules (45 C.F.R. Part 171), certified EHR systems are required to allow patient data export and API access. The FDA v2 Platform will capitalize on this by, for example, using a patient’s consent to connect to their EHR and automatically import relevant medical history or outcomes (like lab results) into the trial dataset. Reciprocally, the Platform’s API can allow an EHR to fetch information about trials a patient is in or the investigational products they are receiving (with patient consent), so that it can be reflected in their medical record for continuity of care. The Secretary shall work with ONC and healthcare providers to pilot and refine these integrations, ensuring that trial participation becomes a **visible and coordinated part of routine care** rather than a separate silo. Providers outside of the trial should be aware (via the EHR) of their patient’s trial participation and any relevant instructions, thereby improving safety and communication.

(e) **Data Quality and Consistency:** To make open data useful, the underlying data must be of high quality and consistent. The Platform shall implement **data standards and validation** rules (as noted in Sec. 202(b)(4)) and publish a **data dictionary** for all common data elements used in trials. The Secretary shall convene, if necessary, a working group of experts (including statisticians, data managers, and patient representatives) to continually refine what data is collected and how it’s structured, balancing richness of information with ease of collection. For example, defining a core outcome set for certain diseases, or standard ways to record patient-reported outcomes, will make it far easier to compare and aggregate results across trials. All such definitions will be aligned with national and international standards where possible. The Secretary should also ensure backward compatibility of data: if standards change, provide mapping for historical data. By maintaining rigorous data discipline, the open data from the Platform will be reliable and readily analyzable by outside parties, fulfilling the promise of transparency.

### SEC. 302. PUBLIC DASHBOARDS AND TRIAL DATA REPORTING.

(a) **Real-Time Public Dashboard:** The Secretary shall maintain on a publicly accessible website a **dashboard of key metrics** about clinical trials conducted under this Act. This dashboard, drawing from the FDA v2 Platform, shall be updated not less frequently than **weekly** (and ideally daily or in real time for certain metrics). It will include, at a summary level: the number of active trials, number of enrolled participants (with breakdowns by condition, geography, demographics as available), average enrollment rates, and other performance indicators of the research enterprise (such as average time from trial launch to primary endpoint readout). It shall highlight notable milestones – for instance, if a trial discovers a significant positive or negative result, the dashboard might flag that finding (with a link to detailed data). The dashboard should be interactive, allowing users to filter by disease or trial phase. Importantly, it must preserve patient privacy: no personal or identifying information will be on the public dashboard, and granular data will be aggregated to levels appropriate for public view. This tool is intended to engage the public and policymakers with the progress being made (or obstacles encountered) in near real-time, fostering accountability for accelerating clinical research.

(b) **Mandatory Results Reporting:** For every clinical trial conducted using the FDA v2 Platform (or otherwise under this Act’s aegis), the sponsor **must report the results of the trial to the public via the Platform**. This requirement is in addition to any obligations under section 402(j) of the Public Health Service Act (ClinicalTrials.gov results reporting) and is intended to be more immediate and comprehensive. **No trial result, whether positive, negative, or inconclusive, may be withheld or unreported.** Within a reasonable period after a trial’s primary completion date (for example, **within 30 days** of reaching the trial’s primary completion, or after early termination), the Platform shall automatically publish summary results to the public dashboard and knowledge base. This includes: the trial’s name, the interventions tested, the number of participants, key outcome measures and their values, and a brief interpretation. If the data are still undergoing analysis, preliminary data can be posted with a note. The final dataset, appropriately de-identified, should be made available for download or via API (see Sec. 301) no later than **3 months** after study completion, except in rare cases where an extension is granted by the Secretary for valid reasons (e.g., data integrity issues being resolved). Failure to comply with this results reporting requirement shall invoke penalties per Title V (and noncompliance will be made public on the dashboard itself, effectively naming sponsors that do not report).

(c) **Negative and Neutral Findings:** The Secretary shall ensure special emphasis on the reporting of negative or null findings. Historically, such results are often unpublished, but under this Act they are equally valuable for building the evidence base and preventing duplication. The public dashboard or associated database should tag or list trials with **negative outcomes** so researchers can easily see, for example, that “Drug X did not significantly improve Outcome Y in Trial Z” and therefore perhaps avoid repeating that experiment. Over time, the accumulation of negative findings will guide research investment towards more promising avenues and discourage ineffective approaches, yielding significant cost savings and protecting patients from unnecessary exposure to ineffective treatments.

(d) **Comprehensive Data Access (Data Commons):** Beyond summary results, the Platform will function as a **data commons** or library where detailed trial datasets can be accessed by qualified parties. The Secretary shall establish a mechanism for researchers to request or directly retrieve de-identified participant-level datasets for trials (subject to any necessary safeguards or data use agreements). This goes further than current summary results reporting by enabling **open science and secondary analysis**. Researchers could, for instance, combine data from multiple trials to identify trends or subgroup effects that individual trials were underpowered to detect. Patients, too, might access their own data and aggregated data to empower their health decisions. The data commons will adhere to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for scientific data. If needed, the Secretary can require that sponsors submit their raw datasets and statistical analysis code to the Platform as part of trial closure (many sponsors already do this for regulatory submissions – here it would also go to the Platform for wider access). All such data sharing will exclude direct identifiers; however, linkage keys may be maintained in a secure enclave if longitudinal follow-up is needed. Any re-identification of participants from shared data is strictly prohibited and subject to penalty.

(e) **Public Engagement and Education:** The Secretary shall accompany the raw data and dashboards with **interpretive guidance** for the public. This includes plain-language summaries of what the results mean (akin to lay summaries) and context to avoid misinterpretation. For example, if a trial shows a new drug reduces disease symptoms by 10%, the lay summary would explain whether that is considered a meaningful improvement, and what the side effect profile was. The Platform’s public interface should allow patients to not only see data but understand it in context (perhaps through visualizations or Q\&A tools). The Secretary may also integrate the Platform with continuing education for health professionals, so doctors and nurses can easily stay up-to-date on emerging evidence from these trials and apply it in practice. Public webinars or forums could be hosted whenever major findings are released, allowing researchers to present the data and answer questions. In essence, data transparency is not just about dumping data into the public domain, but ensuring it leads to **knowledge and action** by making it digestible and actionable for all stakeholders.

### SEC. 303. REAL-TIME RESULTS PUBLICATION AND REGISTRY INTEGRATION.

(a) **Continuous Trial Updates:** The FDA v2 Platform shall implement a system for **continuous or real-time updating of trial outcomes** as data accrue, in cases where revealing interim data does not risk compromising the trial’s integrity. For trials that are blinded or ongoing, the Secretary, in consultation with the trial sponsor and IRB, may determine what level of aggregate data can be ethically released during the trial (for example, recruitment stats and overall incidence of adverse events might be updated in real time, but efficacy outcomes might wait until after database lock). However, for open-label pragmatic trials or trials that have adaptive public health value (e.g., during an outbreak), the expectation is that **key findings are released as soon as they are reliable**. The Platform will support this by allowing data analyses to be pre-specified and then auto-run at interim points, posting results to the public (with appropriate cautionary notes if interim). This agile approach ensures that if a trial uncovers something important – say a drug is clearly harmful or remarkably effective – the world knows right away, not years later. It effectively turns the trial platform also into a **knowledge broadcast system** for critical findings.

(b) **Linkage with ClinicalTrials.gov or Successor:** The Secretary shall ensure that the Platform’s trial registry and results database is either integrated with or reported to **ClinicalTrials.gov** (the existing U.S. registry) or any successor system that may be designated. To minimize duplicate entry for sponsors, data captured in the Platform (trial title, phase, endpoints, etc.) should automatically populate the ClinicalTrials.gov fields via an API or data transfer. Likewise, results posted on the Platform can serve to fulfill the statutory requirements of posting results on ClinicalTrials.gov. The goal is one-stop compliance: if you use the FDA v2 Platform, you inherently meet the legal requirements of trial registration and results disclosure. The Secretary shall work with the Director of the National Library of Medicine (which operates ClinicalTrials.gov) to harmonize data schemas and possibly evolve ClinicalTrials.gov into a more interactive format leveraging the capabilities of the Platform. Eventually, the FDA v2 Platform could **become the primary U.S. clinical trial registry and results database**, with older systems phased into it, but until then a synchronization will occur so that no information is lost between systems.

(c) **International Data Sharing:** In alignment with global transparency initiatives, the Platform’s registry and data should be shared with international clinical trial registries (such as the WHO’s ICTRP or registries of other countries) as appropriate. The Secretary is authorized to enter agreements with foreign regulators or global organizations to exchange trial information. This prevents the need for duplicate trial registries in multiple jurisdictions and ensures that knowledge generated under this Act informs healthcare worldwide. For example, if a trial on the Platform is enrolling patients from multiple countries, it could be registered in one place (the FDA v2 Platform) and those data be automatically provided to each country’s registry per their laws. The Platform can serve as a **global exemplar** of trial transparency, potentially inspiring other nations to adopt similar systems.

(d) **Interim Public Health Findings:** If any interim results from a trial conducted under this Act have significant public health implications – for instance, discovering a previously approved drug has a serious safety issue in the long term, or finding a highly effective use for a readily available therapy – the Secretary (in consultation with FDA scientific leadership) **shall not delay public notification** of such information. Traditional norms might wait for peer-reviewed publication; this Act prioritizes timely public health communication. The Secretary will use the Platform and traditional channels (press releases, alerts to clinicians, etc.) to disseminate crucial findings immediately. To illustrate, if a pragmatic trial finds that a cheap generic drug reduces mortality in a disease by 50%, the Platform would post this and FDA could concurrently issue guidance reflecting the finding, **even as full analysis is ongoing**. This does not equate to formal regulatory approval (which will still require complete data and review), but it gets life-saving information to the field without undue delay. Conversely, if a serious hazard is found, patients and providers will be alerted at once through the Platform’s networks (and via FDA safety communications), thereby potentially stopping harm.

(e) **Ensuring Data Accessibility Over Time:** Data posted on the Platform’s public repositories and dashboards shall remain accessible long-term. The Secretary must maintain archives such that even after a trial is completed and perhaps years have passed, the information is not taken down. This historical data is valuable for retrospective analyses and for transparency. The Platform should have search and filter tools so users can find past trials and results easily (like one might search academic literature). If the Platform is ever superseded by a new system, all data should be migrated to the new system or otherwise preserved in a public archive. In short, the knowledge generated under this Act belongs to the people and must remain in the public domain indefinitely for future generations of researchers and policymakers to learn from.

## TITLE IV—FUNDING AND INCENTIVES

### SEC. 401. FUNDING AUTHORIZATION.

(a) **Authorization of Appropriations:** For the implementation of this Act and the establishment and operation of the FDA v2 Platform and associated programs, there is authorized to be appropriated to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) **such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2026 through 2030**, to be derived from the FDA’s Salaries and Expenses account. These funds shall remain available until expended. It is the sense of Congress that a small fraction of FDA’s annual budget (on the order of a few percent) is a prudent investment to achieve the 80× acceleration in medical progress envisioned by this Act. Appropriated funds should be sufficient to cover technology development, cybersecurity measures, maintenance of the Platform, personnel (including data scientists, software engineers, trial coordinators, and patient liaisons), outreach and education efforts, and grant support as described in subsection (c).

(b) **Use of Funds; Budget Allocation:** The FDA Commissioner shall ensure that funds made available under this section are used specifically to carry out the activities authorized by this Act. This includes (1) contracting for or hiring technical expertise to build and maintain the Platform (Title II and III activities), (2) scaling up FDA’s capacity to oversee an increased number of clinical trials and the real-time data flows (additional staff or training as needed in relevant FDA centers), (3) supporting the IRB centralization and patient safety monitoring infrastructure, and (4) administering the incentive programs in this Title. The FDA shall keep funds for this Act **separate from user fee funds** (i.e., Prescription Drug User Fee Act fees) to ensure that this public health initiative is funded by direct appropriations and not by diverting industry fee resources meant for other purposes.

(c) **Grants and Contracts to Support Participation:** The Secretary may use a portion of the funds to award **grants or contracts** to entities that will facilitate the goals of this Act. For example, grants could be awarded to: patient advocacy organizations to educate and assist patients in trial enrollment; healthcare systems or community clinics to integrate with the Platform and recruit patients (especially in underserved areas to ensure broad participation); technology vendors or open-source projects contributing key modules (like secure mobile apps for outcome reporting or AI tools for analysis); and academic groups to perform research on best practices for pragmatic trial design and data utilization. Priority for funding shall go to proposals that enhance **equity in access** (bringing trials to populations traditionally left out) and **innovation in trial efficiency**. Additionally, the Secretary shall allocate resources to ensure that patients **incur no cost for participation** beyond minimal inconvenience – for instance, covering transportation for any required visits, or providing internet access or devices to patients who need them to use the Platform. The elimination of financial barriers is considered essential to achieving 100% patient access to trials.

(d) **Reporting on Expenditures:** Not later than one year after enactment, and annually thereafter through 2030, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress detailing how funds under this section have been obligated and spent. The report shall include a breakdown of spending by major category (Platform development, operations, outreach, grants, etc.), a summary of progress made (e.g., number of trials launched on the Platform, patients enrolled, reductions in cost or time), and any additional resources needed or expected savings achieved. This transparency in funding will hold the program accountable and help Congress gauge the return on investment in terms of public health outcomes and system efficiencies.

(e) **Future Funding Beyond 2030:** It is the intent of Congress that if the programs under this Act demonstrate success by 2030 – including faster development of cures, cost savings in clinical research, and greater patient satisfaction – then funding should continue as necessary in future years to sustain and expand these efforts. Congress may revisit authorization at that time with the benefit of data and outcomes from the initial period. Nothing in this Act precludes the appropriation of funds in years beyond 2030 to further the Act’s purposes.

### SEC. 402. HEALTH-SAVINGS SHARING INCENTIVE PROGRAM.

(a) **Establishment of Program:** The Secretary, in coordination with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other relevant agencies, shall establish a **Health-Savings Sharing Program** (HSSP) as an incentive mechanism to reward successful innovations that reduce health care costs. The program will operate initially as a **pilot from FY2026 through FY2030**, with the option to become permanent based on results. Under this program, when a clinical trial conducted under this Act (or a series of trials/results enabled by the Platform) identifies a new intervention or strategy that demonstrably **reduces health expenditures** while maintaining or improving patient outcomes, a portion of the realized savings shall be **shared 50/50** between the government (or payer) and the innovator (which may include the trial sponsor, investigators, and potentially patient participant groups as appropriate).

(b) **Qualifying Savings:** Types of innovations that could qualify for shared savings include, but are not limited to:

* **New Effective Therapies that Avert Future Costs:** e.g., a low-cost generic drug or lifestyle intervention is found to significantly reduce hospitalizations or expensive procedures for a disease. If widespread adoption of this finding would cut healthcare spending (for a payer like Medicare) by, say, \$100 million per year, the HSSP could award up to \$50 million of that back to the innovators.
* **Efficiencies in Care Delivery:** e.g., a pragmatic trial shows that a shorter course of treatment is just as effective as a longer one, saving medication costs; or that home-based management of a condition yields equal outcomes to hospital stays at lower cost.
* **Avoidance of Ineffective or Harmful Interventions:** e.g., trials determine that an expensive drug or procedure offers no benefit (or is inferior to cheaper alternatives), enabling discontinuation of that expense – the health system savings from not using the ineffective approach could be shared.

Savings should be **calculated in a robust, actuarial manner**, using data from CMS or other insurers to estimate the difference in expected spending due to the innovation. The Secretary and the CMS Office of the Actuary shall develop methodology to attribute savings fairly and prevent gaming. Only net savings (after accounting for any implementation costs of the new intervention) are shareable.

(c) **Optional Participation:** Participation in HSSP is **voluntary** for trial sponsors. When designing a trial or development program, sponsors can declare their intent to opt into the Health-Savings Sharing incentive. By opting in, they agree to certain terms – for example, that if their intervention is successful, they will disseminate it broadly (perhaps forgo exclusive pricing that would capture the savings via high prices, since instead they’ll get a share of savings as a reward). This is particularly aimed at interventions that might not be attractive under the normal market model (such as non-patentable therapies, or cures that permanently eliminate a disease). For instance, a university or nonprofit that finds a **low-cost cure for a chronic illness** (thereby obviating decades of treatment costs) could opt for a shared-savings payment since the cure itself might not be profitable to sell. Companies can also opt in if they see advantage in a reward versus uncertain market uptake.

(d) **Payment Mechanism:** The Secretary, through CMS, is authorized to make **lump-sum payments or milestone payments** to the innovator out of the savings realized in federal health programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid). For savings accruing to private insurers, the Secretary may encourage or facilitate similar arrangements (and nothing prohibits private payers from independently contracting with innovators to share savings). The law explicitly allows CMS to **enter into savings-sharing contracts** with organizations – for example, if a trial sponsored by a coalition of researchers yields a cost-saving outcome, CMS can directly pay that coalition a negotiated fraction of the expected Medicare savings. The total federal payments under HSSP shall not exceed the federal share of actual savings – this ensures the program is budget-neutral or positive for the taxpayer. In fact, ideally the government saves money even after paying the reward. To ensure fiscal prudence, each savings-sharing agreement must be certified by CMS actuaries as expected to produce net savings.

(e) **Incentive Alignment:** The 50/50 split mentioned is a general target; the Secretary may adjust the exact percentage or structure (for example, 50% of savings for first 3 years, then taper) to best incentivize behavior while protecting public funds. The key principle is that **innovators can earn substantial rewards for value creation** – potentially comparable to profits they might get through patents, but derived from social savings rather than high prices. If multiple parties contributed to an innovation (e.g., data came from many trials, or a patient organization and a pharma company collaborated), the Secretary will determine a fair allocation of the shared savings among them, possibly requiring a mutual agreement or using an arbitration mechanism.

(f) **Use of Rewards:** Recipients of HSSP payments are encouraged (though not required by law) to reinvest a portion of the rewards into further research or implementation efforts, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation. For example, a non-profit that receives a \$50 million reward for a cost-saving discovery might use it to fund more trials on the Platform. The Secretary shall track how these funds appear to influence R\&D investment patterns and report to Congress on the efficacy of the incentive.

(g) **Transparency and Accountability:** All Health-Savings Sharing agreements and payouts should be transparent to avoid any perception of undue benefit. The Secretary will publish an annual summary of HSSP activities, including which interventions were rewarded, how savings were calculated, and amounts paid. If an expected savings does not materialize (e.g., an intervention isn’t adopted as widely as thought, or its effect was overestimated), the agreements can include **claw-back provisions or adjustments** to protect against overpayment.

(h) **Sunset or Extension:** The pilot phase of HSSP will run through FY2030. By the end of FY2029, the Secretary shall deliver a detailed report to Congress evaluating the program – including total savings generated, payments made, changes in innovation trends, and any unintended consequences. If the program is successful (i.e., clearly induced beneficial research and saved money), Congress may act to extend or expand it. Conversely, if it underperforms or is abused, Congress may modify or terminate it. However, any agreements executed during the pilot that promise payments beyond 2030 (for example, sharing savings for X years) shall remain honored even if the program isn’t renewed, to maintain government credibility.

(i) **Rule of Construction:** Nothing in this section shall be construed to mandate price setting or restrict normal market-based profits for pharmaceutical or device companies outside of the voluntary shared-savings contracts. The HSSP is an **optional pathway** to reward certain innovations and does not replace existing incentives like patents or market exclusivity (which sponsors may still utilize if they do not opt for HSSP). The goal is simply to **offer an alternative** especially suited for cases where traditional incentives are insufficient (such as non-patentable therapies, vaccines for eradication of diseases, etc.). Sponsors may choose the path that best fits their product and mission.

## TITLE V—GENERAL PROVISIONS

### SEC. 501. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) **Regulatory Authority:** The provisions of this Act shall be enforced by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs using the authorities of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), Public Health Service Act, and other applicable laws. A violation of any requirement of this Act or regulations promulgated hereunder shall be deemed a **prohibited act** under section 301 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. 331) and subject to the penalties (civil or criminal) provided by law, as well as any other remedies available to the Secretary. This includes, for example, if a sponsor fails to report trial results (violating Title III of this Act), such failure may be treated equivalently to failing to submit required clinical trial results under 42 U.S.C. 282(j) (with FDA authorized to seek civil monetary penalties). The Secretary should promulgate regulations or guidance as needed to clarify how existing enforcement tools will apply in the context of the Platform (e.g., warning letters, civil fines, injunctions for non-compliance, etc.).

(b) **Compliance Audits:** The Secretary shall conduct periodic **audits and inspections** of activities under this Act to ensure compliance. This may include audits of: the informed consent process (to ensure patients are properly consented in Sec. 106), data integrity checks on the Platform, security penetration testing (to enforce data security standards), and trial conduct reviews. The FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program shall adapt to the decentralized nature of these trials by developing inspection techniques suitable for largely digital records and virtual sites. If serious non-compliance is found (e.g., falsification of data, improper patient enrollment without consent, breach of privacy protections), the Secretary has authority to **suspend or terminate the trial** on the Platform, remove the responsible investigators or sponsors from participation in the program, and/or seize investigational products as necessary to protect public health.

(c) **Participant Rights Enforcement:** The Secretary shall establish a mechanism for patients to report any grievances or violations of their rights under this Act. This could be a dedicated ombudsman or help line attached to the Platform. For example, if a patient believes they were unfairly excluded from a trial without scientific reason, or that their data was used without consent, they can lodge a complaint. The Secretary will investigate such complaints and take remedial action as appropriate, which might include requiring a sponsor to enroll a wrongfully excluded patient (if trial still ongoing), mandating additional consent measures, or sanctioning parties who violated protocols. Patients also retain any private right of action they may have under other laws for egregious harms, but this Act itself does not newly create a private right to sue except through the administrative processes described.

(d) **Penalties for Data Withholding or Misrepresentation:** If any person knowingly and willfully withholds data or provides false or misleading information in connection with any trial or report under this Act, they shall be subject to enhanced penalties. This could include, in the case of sponsors, fines up to \$10,000 for each day of knowing delay in reporting required trial results (building on existing ClinicalTrials.gov penalty authority), and for individuals, potential disqualification from further research and referral for criminal prosecution under fraud or false statements statutes (e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1001). The integrity of the Platform’s data is paramount – therefore, enforcement will be strict against those who attempt to undermine transparency or scientific validity.

(e) **Collaborative Enforcement Approach:** The Secretary may collaborate with other enforcement bodies as needed. For instance, if a trial is international and a foreign entity is violating provisions, FDA may coordinate with foreign regulators to address it. If patterns of off-platform non-compliance (like companies not using the Platform to hide trials) are observed, broader policy measures could be recommended. The goal of enforcement is not to punish, but to **ensure compliance** and thus the success of the Act’s mission. To that end, the Secretary might initially focus on education and technical assistance to bring parties into compliance, using penalties more as a last resort for willful or repeated violations.

### SEC. 502. RULEMAKING AUTHORITY.

(a) **Interim Final Rulemaking:** Not later than **180 days** after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue such interim final regulations as are necessary to implement the substantive provisions of Titles I, II, and III. The complexity of building the Platform and new processes may require new regulations or amendments to existing ones (for example, adapting 21 C.F.R. Part 312 on INDs to pragmatic trials, or Part 11 on electronic records to the Platform’s features). The Secretary is authorized to use expedited rulemaking: interim final rules may become effective upon publication (with opportunity for public comment post-effect) if the Secretary finds that the urgent need to accelerate clinical research justifies it. Areas likely needing rulemaking include: **data privacy and security standards** specific to the Platform; procedures for IRB review in a centralized context; technical standards adoption; and the details of the Health-Savings Sharing Program. The Secretary shall engage stakeholders (through workshops, requests for information, etc.) during this initial rulemaking phase to gather input.

(b) **Updates and Guidance:** As the Platform and associated practices evolve, the Secretary is authorized to **update regulations and issue guidance documents** without further statutory action, so long as they remain consistent with this Act’s intent. The Secretary should periodically assess whether any FDA regulations or policies unintentionally hinder the goals of this Act (e.g., overly rigid documentation requirements that could be streamlined) and modify them accordingly. Within one year of enactment, FDA shall update guidance on the use of **real-world evidence and decentralized trial methods** to explicitly incorporate how the Platform meets evidentiary standards. The Secretary shall also issue a guidance addressing how informed consent can be obtained electronically and still meet FDA requirements, to give sponsors confidence in using the digital consent features (drawing from OHRP and FDA joint guidance on e-consent). Non-binding guidance can clarify many operational questions for sponsors and IRBs quickly, whereas regulations will set the enforceable standards.

(c) **Consultation and Advisory Input:** In exercising rulemaking authority under this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the advisory committee established in section 201(f), as well as any existing federal advisory committees that might provide relevant expertise (such as FDA’s Science Board, advisory committees on ethics, etc.). The Secretary should especially seek input from patient representatives during the formulation of rules that will affect the user experience or rights (for example, rules on returning trial results to participants). The Secretary may also coordinate with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on data security rulemaking, and with the Office for Civil Rights on HIPAA-related aspects, ensuring a harmonized federal approach.

(d) **State Preemption:** Given the interstate and global nature of the FDA v2 Platform and trials, and to ensure a uniform framework, Congress intends to **preempt state laws** only to the extent that such laws conflict with the operation of this Act. The Secretary may include in regulations a clarification of preemption: for instance, if a state has a law that would prohibit or overly restrict remote clinical trial participation or e-consent, this federal Act (under Congress’s commerce and science powers) would override it. However, this Act is not intended to preempt state laws that provide **additional patient safety protections or privacy safeguards** unless those make the operation of the Platform infeasible. The rulemaking can delineate these boundaries, ensuring that states cannot erect barriers to patient participation (like limiting access to investigational drugs that this Act would allow), but states can still enforce general medical practice standards or require things like licensing for telehealth, so long as those do not explicitly negate the rights and processes herein.

(e) **Continuous Review:** The Secretary shall keep Congress informed if any further legislative changes are needed beyond rulemaking authority. By the third year of implementation, the Secretary should evaluate whether any statutory adjustments would enhance the Platform’s effectiveness (for example, changes to intellectual property law or payment policy to further support the new model) and report those recommendations. This invites a dynamic regulatory approach, where the executive branch is actively refining the program and the legislative branch stands ready to assist if new authority is required.

### SEC. 503. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the **remainder** of the Act and the application of the provisions therein to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. The provisions of this Act are declared to be severable. Congress further states its intention that it would have passed each and every section, clause, sentence, and part of this Act even if any one or more provisions were subsequently determined to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable. In particular, if the patient “Right to Trial” in Title I or any specific requirement (like data transparency mandates) is struck down by a court, it is the intent of Congress that all other components – such as the establishment of the Platform and funding provisions – remain in full force, as they independently advance the Act’s overarching goal of accelerating medical progress and expanding clinical trial access.
