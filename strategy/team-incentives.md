# Algorithmic Contribution & Incentive Policy

This document outlines a novel incentive structure for the founding team, core contributors, and key advisors of the War on Disease initiative. It moves beyond conventional, arbitrary fixed-percentage allocations and time-based vesting to a dynamic system that rewards verifiable, high-impact work and early-stage risk.

## 1. Core Principles

Our incentive structure is a direct reflection of our mission to build a new type of public institution.
- **Earned, Not Granted:** Ownership is earned by creating verifiable value, not granted in opaque, upfront allocations.
- **Risk-Adjusted Rewards:** The system explicitly and mathematically rewards those who take the greatest risk by contributing during the earliest, most uncertain phases of the project.
- **Algorithmic Transparency:** The formula for calculating contributions is open, transparent, and applies to all contributors, including the founder.
- **Mission Alignment:** The structure is designed to relentlessly focus all contributors on the project's critical path milestones.

## 2. The "Contribution Points" Model

Instead of allocating a fixed percentage of the network, we value all work done using a transparent formula. The output of this formula is **Contribution Points**.

**`Contribution Points = (Hours Worked) x (Role-Based Rate) x (Risk Multiplier)`**

- **Hours Worked:** All core contributors will use a transparent, auditable system to log hours worked on project-critical tasks.
- **Role-Based Rate:** Each role has a fair, pre-agreed market hourly rate to value their labor (e.g., Senior Engineer: $150/hr, General Counsel: $300/hr, etc.).
- **Risk Multiplier:** This is the most critical component for rewarding risk. The multiplier decreases as the project de-risks itself by completing phases.

| Project Phase | Risk Multiplier | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 0 (Bootstrap)** | **10x** | Highest risk; no funding, no team, concept stage. |
| **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)** | **5x** | High risk; pre-product, pre-main-raise. |
| **Phase 2 (Mobilization)** | **2x** | Medium risk; campaign execution, political risk. |
| **Phase 3 (Execution)** | **1x** | Lower risk; treasury is funded, focus is on execution. |

## 3. The Team Allocation Pool & Distribution

The **20% "Founding Team & Advisors" pool** is not a pre-allocation, but a **budget** from which Contribution Points are paid out.

- **Distribution Mechanism:** At the Token Generation Event (TGE), the total Contribution Points of all contributors are summed up. Each contributor receives a pro-rata share of the 20% team allocation pool based on their percentage of the total points.
- **Example:**
  - The Founder has earned 1,000,000 Contribution Points.
  - The General Counsel has earned 500,000 Contribution Points.
  - The total points earned by all contributors is 10,000,000.
  - The Founder would receive: `(1,000,000 / 10,000,000) * 20% = 10%` of the team pool, or 2% of the total token supply.
  - The General Counsel would receive: `(500,000 / 10,000,000) * 20% = 5%` of the team pool, or 1% of the total token supply.

## 4. Cash vs. At-Risk Compensation

To provide stability for core contributors while solving for the "people need to eat" problem, we will use a hybrid compensation model.

1.  **Determine Market Rate:** For each role, we establish a fair market salary (e.g., Senior Engineer: $200,000/year).
2.  **Offer a Base Cash Salary:** The project will offer a livable cash salary, paid in fiat or stablecoin. This will be a percentage of the market rate (e.g., 60%), ensuring we can attract top talent while conserving capital.
    - *Example:* For a $200k market rate, the cash salary is **$120,000/year**.
3.  **Value the "At-Risk" Contribution:** The remaining portion of the salary is the contributor's "at-risk" investment of their labor into the project.
    - *Example:* `$200,000 (Market) - $120,000 (Cash) = $80,000 (At-Risk Portion)`
4.  **Reward the Risk:** This "at-risk" portion is what gets valued and multiplied by the **Contribution Points** formula. This model ensures that contributors are compensated for their risk and are powerfully aligned with the project's success.

For key roles, we can offer flexibility on this "slider," allowing a candidate to choose between a higher cash salary for fewer Contribution Points, or a lower cash salary for a greater share of the potential upside.

## 5. The Role of Prediction Markets: A Public Risk Oracle

To provide a transparent, real-time measure of the project's perceived risk, we will sponsor a prediction market on a platform like Polymarket or Metaculus.

- **The Market:** "Will the 1% Treaty be ratified by at least one G7 nation by 2030?"
- **The Purpose:** The market's live probability (e.g., "3.5%") will serve as the project's single most important public Key Performance Indicator (KPI).
- **Important Clarification:** This probability is **not** a direct input into the compensation formula. Its purpose is to provide an objective, external signal of the project's progress and risk level. This helps contributors gauge the risk of their at-risk compensation and holds leadership accountable for increasing the probability of success.

## 6. Advantages of this Model

- **Fair & Objective:** Directly rewards verifiable work and risk.
- **Avoids "Sleaze":** Moves completely away from the arbitrary nature of startup equity negotiations.
- **Incentivizes Early Contribution:** The multiplier heavily rewards those who join when the risk is highest.
- **Flexible & Scalable:** Easily accommodates new contributors (full-time, part-time, contract) without needing to re-negotiate equity splits.
