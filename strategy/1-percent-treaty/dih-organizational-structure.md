# Decentralized Institutes of Health - Complete Organizational Structure

## Executive Summary

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is expanding from a single treasury entity into a comprehensive ecosystem that mirrors the NIH structure while offering decentralized governance, prestigious titles, and community-specific focus areas. This expansion serves as a strategic recruitment tool for the 1% Treaty referendum effort, aligning diverse communities around specific health research domains.

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Expand the DIH Structure?

1. **Community Alignment**: Each sub-agency attracts specific communities with shared interests
2. **Prestigious Titles**: People love prestigious titles and being part of important organizations
3. **Funding Specialization**: Each sub-agency can manage its own funding pool from the 1% Treaty
4. **Referendum Mobilization**: Each sub-agency mobilizes its specific community for the 1% Treaty referendum
5. **Competitive Innovation**: Sub-agencies compete for funding and recognition, driving excellence
