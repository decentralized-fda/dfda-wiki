# Canonical Roadmap — 1% Treaty → DIH → dFDA

The primary objective is global adoption of the [1% Treaty](./1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md), creation and funding of the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md), and sustained financing for the most efficient forms of medical research (primarily subsidizing patient participation in high value and high efficiency decentralized clinical trials). Financing is coordinated via [VICTORY Instruments Tokenomics](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md), with investor rationale in the [Investment Thesis](./../economic-models/victory-bond-investment-thesis.md) and proposed regulatory reform in the [Impact Securities Act (Draft)](./../regulatory/impact-securities-reform.md).

## PRELUDE: POLICY & FINANCING ACTIVATION (Parallel Track)

Run these tracks in parallel with technical build to unlock capital and legitimacy for the 1% Treaty → DIH → dFDA sequence.

1. Impact Securities Reform (model law)
   - Tasks: Build coalition; secure sponsors; file the [Impact Securities Act (Draft)](./../regulatory/impact-securities-reform.md); public comment; hearing kit; press kit.
   - Outcome: Universal exemption conditioned on live on‑chain disclosures; no pre‑filing; outcome‑linked marketing safe harbor; token safe harbor; anti‑fraud only.

2. Interim Fundraising (before reform)
   - Structure: Reg D / Reg S raises using a simplified “high‑yield impact loan + performance bonuses” framing; philanthropic first‑loss.
   - Docs: [Financing Structure](./warondisease-landing.md#financing-structure-for-investors), [VICTORY Tokenomics](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md), [Investment Thesis](./../economic-models/victory-bond-investment-thesis.md#how-we-talk-about-returns-standardized-language).
   - Ops: Stand up on‑chain disclosures (proof‑of‑reserves, covenant checks, coverage ratio dashboards) now to ease migration post‑reform.

3. Global Referendum Scaling
   - Goal: 3.5% participation with referral rewards; fraud controls per [Verification & Fraud Prevention](./verification-and-fraud-prevention.md).
   - Budget: \$56M for 280M verified votes (\$0.20 each) per [landing](./warondisease-landing.md#activation-energy-sequence-who-we-bribe-first).

4. Independent Expenditures Engine (jurisdictional)
   - Tasks: Set up independent‑expenditure entities; strict non‑coordination; firewall US vs non‑US; legal review per [Legal Compliance](./legal-compliance-framework.md).
   - Use: Target priority elections; tie spend to verified district mandates.

5. Treaty Campaign & Negotiation
   - Targets: US/EU first; publish pledge tracker; use referendum mandate + IE leverage; publish fiscal impact memos.
   - Metric: First national treaty commitments within 24–36 months.

6. DIH Vaults & Modules
   - Tasks: Implement [DIH treasury](./../features/treasury/dih-treasury-architecture.md) modules (grants, QF, subsidies, bounties); publish policies; seed pilot programs.
   - Controls: On‑chain proofs, incident response, governance timelocks.

7. Investor Disclosures & Marketing (standardized)
   - Key Facts box; outcome‑linked target language; benchmark citations; live dashboards; risk section mirroring [thesis](./../economic-models/victory-bond-investment-thesis.md#10-assessing-realism-risks-repayment-timeline-and-contingencies).

## DIH-Funded Programs

Once the DIH is funded via the 1% Treaty, it will allocate capital to high-impact programs. Each program will have its own detailed implementation plan.

- **[dFDA Platform Technical Roadmap](../features/dfda-roadmap.md)**: The detailed plan for engineering the decentralized clinical trial platform. This is the first and primary program to be funded.
- *(Placeholder for future DIH-funded initiatives, e.g., Longevity Prize, Mental Health Moonshot, etc.)*
