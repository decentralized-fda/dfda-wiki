# Canonical Roadmap: From Plan to Global Impact

This document outlines the high-level, multi-year strategy to achieve the 1% Treaty. It presents a logical sequence of major phases, from initial planning to global impact. Each step is a massive undertaking with its own detailed implementation plan, which is linked accordingly.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Legal Framework (Months 1-12)

**Goal:** Prepare the plan, establish the infrastructure, and reform the laws to make the mission possible.

- [ ] **Package the Plan:** Finalize core documents ([Investment Thesis](../economic-models/victory-bond-investment-thesis.md), [Landing Page](./warondisease-landing.md)) to create a compelling, data-driven case for donors, investors, and policymakers.
- [ ] **Establish Legal & On-Chain Infrastructure:** Deploy the initial secure, transparent on-chain treasury ([DIH Treasury Architecture](../features/treasury/dih-treasury-architecture.md)) and establish legal entities to accept funds compliantly.
- [ ] **Achieve Regulatory Reform:** Advocate for and pass the [Impact Securities Reform Act](../regulatory/impact-securities-reform.md) to enable low-friction, transparent financing for the main capital raise.

---

## Phase 2: Capital & Political Mobilization (Months 12-36)

**Goal:** Raise the necessary capital and generate an undeniable global political mandate.

- [ ] **Launch the Primary Capital Raise:** Sell [\$VICTORY Bonds](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md) under the new impact securities framework, targeting a \$1.2-2.5B raise to fund the global campaign.
- [ ] **Execute the Global Referendum:** Launch the campaign to secure 3.5% global participation (280M+ votes) for the 1% Treaty, creating the political mandate ([Global Referendum Implementation](./referendum/global-referendum-implementation.md)).
- [ ] **Secure Treaty Adoption:** Leverage the referendum mandate and a well-funded independent expenditure engine to achieve legal adoption of the 1% Treaty in key nations.

---

## Phase 3: Execution & Impact (Years 3-5+)

**Goal:** Receive the treaty funds, deliver on promises to investors, and execute the mission.

- [ ] **Activate the DIH Treasury:** Begin receiving the 1% revenue stream (\$27B+ annually) from signatory nations.
- [ ] **Deliver Superior Returns to Investors:** Repay `\$VICTORY Bond` holders with a return engineered to be superior to alternative investments, fulfilling the core financial promise.
- [ ] **Fund Global Public Goods:** Deploy treasury funds to high-impact initiatives, with the primary focus on subsidizing patient participation in efficient, decentralized clinical trials via the **[dFDA Platform Technical Roadmap](../features/dfda-roadmap.md)**.
