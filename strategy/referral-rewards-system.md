## Why 3.5%? The Tipping Point for Systemic Change

Research shows that when just **3.5% of a population** actively participates in a movement, systemic change becomes highly likely ([source](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)). For the FDA Upgrade and Right to Trial Act, this means mobilizing roughly **12 million Americans** to vote or take action—enough to force policy transformation and unlock global decentralized clinical trials.

> The "3.5% rule" is based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, who analyzed hundreds of nonviolent movements and found that those engaging at least 3.5% of the population have never failed to achieve serious political change. This threshold is now widely cited as the tipping point for successful social movements ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), [Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s7wm)).

## The 80X Efficiency Benchmark: Oxford RECOVERY Trial

The [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) demonstrated that decentralized, pragmatic trials can reduce per-patient costs from **$41,000** to **$500**—an **80X efficiency gain** ([Manhattan Institute](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)). This model saved over **1 million lives** globally by rapidly identifying effective COVID-19 treatments ([UKRI Impact Report](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/how-we-are-doing/research-outcomes-and-impact/mrc/recovery-trial-identifies-covid-19-treatments/)).

> **Goal:** Replicate this 80X efficiency for all medical research by passing the FDA Upgrade and Right to Trial Act—using viral referral rewards to reach the 3.5% tipping point.

## How Referral Rewards Drive Viral Participation

A well-designed referral-rewards system can:
- **Drop verified-vote costs below $1** (and as low as $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios)
- Mobilize millions through organic, peer-driven sharing
- Incentivize both direct action and network growth

### Cost Breakdown (per verified vote)
| Component         | Conservative | Aggressive (Viral) | Notes                                 |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Direct Rewards   | $0.50–$0.75  | $0.30–$0.50        | Cash, merch, or crypto                |
| Paid Reach       | $0.75–$1.00  | $0.10              | Ads, influencer micro-fees            |
| Verification     | $0.25        | $0.05              | KYC-lite vs. email/phone only         |
| **Total**        | **$1.50–$2** | **$0.45–$0.65**    | Can drop to $0.20–$0.30 in best case  |

**Benchmarks:**
- [EveryLibrary 2023](https://www.everylibrary.org/): $0.18 per verified action
- [Avaaz 2022](https://secure.avaaz.org/): $0.32 per verified pledge
- [GiveDirectly 2021](https://www.givedirectly.org/): $0.48 per verified crypto match

## Practical Steps to Achieve Viral Scale

1. **Jackpot-Lottery + Leaderboard**
   - Weekly $500 prizes for top referrers
   - Random $50 draws for anyone with ≥1 referral
   - Keeps marginal cost per new vote near zero after pool is funded
2. **Lower-Touch Verification (Early Phases)**
   - Email + phone OTP for initial onboarding
   - Add selfie-ID only when legally required
   - Saves $0.15–$0.20 per participant
3. **Partner Newsletters > Paid Ads**
   - Ready-to-send HTML for disease foundations, patient forums, Reddit, etc.
   - A single 100k-subscriber list at 5% conversion = 5,000 votes for almost no incremental cash
4. **Track K-Factor (Viral Coefficient) Weekly**
   - K > 0.8: Cut ad spend
   - K < 0.5: Top up jackpot or test new creatives

## Cost Scenarios for 200,000 Verified Votes
| Scenario             | Reward Pool | Paid Ads | Ops    | Total   | $/vote |
|----------------------|------------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Baseline (roadmap)   | $25k       | $150k    | $25k   | $200k   | $1.00  |
| Partner-list heavy   | $25k       | $40k     | $20k   | $85k    | $0.43  |
| Viral best-case      | $25k       | $15k     | $10k   | $50k    | $0.25  |

## Why This Matters: Quantitative Impact

- **Replicating RECOVERY's 80X efficiency** would allow the U.S. to run 80 times more trials for the same budget ([reference](reference/recovery-trial.md)).
- Mobilizing 3.5% of the population with referral rewards can create the political will to pass the FDA Upgrade and Right to Trial Act, unlocking these savings for all diseases.
- **Potential: Save millions of lives, cut drug development costs by 95%, and accelerate cures for rare and common diseases alike.**

**With a disciplined referral-reward loop—and the right partner lists—we can comfortably beat $1 per verified vote and may reach sub-$0.30 territory. This is the lever to unlock 80X faster medical progress for everyone.**
