# High Level Strategy for War on Disease

1. Declaration of War
   1. analogize harm from disease to harm from Nazis and the reconfiguration of the entire American economy to fight and win world war 2 in under 5 years.  the only reason we can't make a damn website to cure disease is because we expect basically nothing from our institutions despite $50B in annual budgets.
2. Assemble Joint Strategic Command (7-9 members emulating Lincoln's war cabinet)
3. Draft Disease Eradication Act
   1. including global decentralized FDA open-source interoperable automated clinical trial platform with treatment outcome rankings
   2. Decentralized Institutes of Health to manage rewards described
   3. Expanded DIH organizational structure with sub-agencies mirroring NIH institutes for community alignment and title incentives
4. Issue $WAR bonds to raise money
   1. buyers receive 50% of healthcare savings resulting from adoption)
   2. Include economic savings model with confidence intervals estimating ROI
   3. Aim to exceed $300M annually spent lobbying by industry to preserve status quo mass disease state
5. Use $WAR bonds to reward referrals for getting people to vote on global referendum on Disease Eradication Act
   1. Aim for 3.5% of the population of each nation, which is historically enough to produce major societal advancements (less than 10% of people suffering from chronic disease)
6. Public support is used as evidence to leaders to pause all military efforts and join together to fund and implement the Disease Eradication Act
   1. Once all disease is eradicated, they may resume pissing away trillions building nuclear weapons and murderbots again
