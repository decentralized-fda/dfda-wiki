# War gets 20X more funding than curing disease.

# This is stupid.

# Let's fix it by paying people to vote for the obvious solution.

---

## The Problem

Humanity spends **\$2.44 trillion** on military vs **\$120 billion** on medical research.

Military contractors get concentrated benefits. Health gets diffuse costs.

Result: We fund destruction 20X more than cures.

---

## The Solution

**Step 1:** Pay people \$0.20 for each person who votes on a global referendum via their link.

**Step 2:** When we hit 3.5% of humanity, we have proof the world wants this.

**Step 3:** Create a trustless treasury that pays retroactive rewards to politicians who vote for their country to join the 1% Treaty.

**Step 4:** The treasury funds EVERYONE in health - universities, pharma, nonprofits, government agencies - through democratically controlled sub-DAOs.

---

## Why This Works

**You get paid:** \$0.20 per referendum voter you refer. Scale that up.

**Every health institution gets more money:** NIH, Harvard Medical, Pfizer, patient advocacy groups - everyone gets 2-5X their current funding.

**Politicians get rewarded:** Vote for the treaty, get paid. Massive public support makes it safe.

**Military balance preserved:** Everyone moves 1% together. No country falls behind.

**No new bureaucracy:** Fund existing institutions through transparent, democratic allocation.

## How We Beat Concentrated Interests

**The military-industrial complex wins because:**
- Defense contractors get massive, concentrated profits
- Health benefits are diffuse across everyone
- Politicians get lobbied by the concentrated side

**We flip this by:**
- Making health funding MORE profitable than weapons
- Paying everyone who helps (referendum voters, politicians, institutions)
- Creating a bigger coalition than military contractors

## The Treasury Model

**[\$VICTORY Bonds](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):** Bootstrap funding now, repaid by treaty inflows.

**[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md):** Democratic treasury that funds sub-DAOs for each health area.

**Sub-DAOs fund existing institutions:** 
- Decentralized Institute of Mental Health → funds universities, pharma, nonprofits working on depression, anxiety, etc.
- Decentralized Institute of Cancer Research → funds MD Anderson, pharmaceutical companies, patient advocacy groups
- Decentralized Institute of Aging → funds longevity research at every institution

**Everyone gets more money. No one gets displaced.**

**[Calculate your institution's allocation](./1-percent-treaty/institutional-funding-calculator.md)** → See how much your university/company/nonprofit would receive.

**[Join the coalition](./coalition-building.md)** → Help coordinate health institutions to support the treaty.

## For Institutions

**Pharmaceutical companies:** Get 2-5X more R&D funding for the same work.

**Universities:** Massive increase in research grants across all health departments.

**Patient advocacy groups:** Direct funding for your cause areas.

**Government health agencies:** Expanded budgets without fighting for appropriations.

**Contact us:** [institutions@warondisease.org](mailto:institutions@warondisease.org) to calculate your potential funding increase.

## The Math

**3.5% of humanity = ~280 million people**

**\$0.20 × 280 million = \$56 million** to create overwhelming public mandate

**\$56 million vs \$24 billion/year** = 430X return on initial referendum investment

**Result:** Every health institution gets 2-5X more funding. Forever.
