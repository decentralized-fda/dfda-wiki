title: War on Disease — End Mass Disease by Redirecting 1%
description: A simple plan to redirect 1% of global military spending into decentralized clinical trials (dFDA) funded by the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH), with referral rewards and $VICTORY instruments to mobilize the world.

## The Mission

We will end mass disease by reallocating just 1% of global military spending into an open, automated clinical research system. This is not a new bureaucracy. It is a verifiable, on-chain, AI-powered pipeline that pays for patient participation and delivers evidence faster and cheaper.

## How It Fits Together

- [The 1% Treaty](./1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md)
  - Nations pledge 1% of military budgets to the DIH treasury. Relative power stays constant; resources shift from destruction to cures.
- [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md)
  - A treasury that funds patient subsidies, prizes, and infrastructure. Governance is automated-by-default; humans are emergency custodians with sunsets. See [Treasury Architecture](../features/treasury/dih-treasury-architecture.md).
- dFDA — the autonomous trials platform
  - AI agents and smart contracts coordinate decentralized trials and real-world evidence. See [On-Chain and AI Architecture](../architecture/dih-onchain-architecture.md) and [Roadmap](./roadmap.md).
- [Org structure](./1-percent-treaty/dih-org-structure.md)
  - Sub-institutes (Aging, Cancer, etc.) and cross-cutting services (Data, Safety, AI) run as APIs/contracts with earned recognition.
- [Incentives Layer](./incentives-layer.md)
  - Referrals, credentials, impact certificates (Hypercerts), bounties/prizes, ambassador pools, leaderboards.
- [$VICTORY Bonds/Tokens](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md)
  - Bootstraps the treasury today; repaid by treaty inflows and verified savings.

## Why Reallocate 1% (instead of “spend more on health”)?

- Reallocation preserves the balance of power. Everyone moves 1% together → no country falls behind; everyone gains cures.
- Printing money to “add health spending” rarely reallocates real resources; it inflates nominal budgets while labor and capital continue chasing defense demand. A treaty-locked reallocation is how you redirect actual talent, factories, and capital to health.
- Another centralized org just adds administrative thrash. This design makes decisions code + data + oracles; no standing committees.

- [Sign the global referendum](./referendum/global-referendum-implementation.md) and get counted in a verifiable tally.
- [Get your referral link](./referral-rewards-system.md) to help reach the 3.5% tipping point with jackpots and leaderboards.
- [Fund the war on disease](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md) via $VICTORY instruments.
- [Build and earn](./open-ecosystem-and-bounty-model.md) with bounties, prizes, and merge-to-earn.
- [Join or found an institute](./1-percent-treaty/institute-charter-template.md) under the DIH umbrella.

## Guarantees and Guardrails

- Automated-by-default execution with public rules; emergency-only DAO overrides with strict sunsets.
- Verifiable oracles for evidence, safety, identity/COI, and savings; immutable logs replace reports.
- Safety circuit-breakers and clawbacks; transparent audits funded by bounties.
