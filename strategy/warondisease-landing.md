title: War on Disease — End Mass Disease by Redirecting 1%
description: A simple plan to redirect 1% of global military spending into decentralized clinical trials (dFDA) funded by the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH), with referral rewards and \$VICTORY instruments to mobilize the world.

## The Mission

Take 1% of the world’s military budgets and use it to cure disease. In 2023, global military spending was about \$2.44 trillion [source](mdc:https:/www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2024/world-military-expenditure-reaches-record-high-2023). 1% of that is roughly \$24 billion per year redirected to health.

We’ll use open software and clear rules to pay people to join studies and to publish results fast. Everything runs on public ledgers with AI helpers—not a new bureaucracy.

## How It Fits Together

- [The 1% Treaty](./1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md)
  - Countries move 1% together, so the military balance stays the same. Money shifts from weapons to cures.
- [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md)
  - A shared treasury that pays patients, funds prizes, and builds common tools. Rules are automated by default; people step in only for emergencies with strict time limits. See [Treasury Architecture](../features/treasury/dih-treasury-architecture.md).
- dFDA — the autonomous trials platform
  - AI and smart contracts run decentralized trials and collect real‑world evidence. See [On-Chain and AI Architecture](../architecture/dih-onchain-architecture.md) and [Roadmap](./roadmap.md).
- [Org structure](./1-percent-treaty/dih-org-structure.md)
  - Topic-focused institutes (Aging, Cancer, etc.) and shared services (Data, Safety, AI) run like APIs/contracts and earn credibility by performance.
- [Incentives Layer](./incentives-layer.md)
  - Referrals, credentials, impact certificates (Hypercerts), bounties/prizes, ambassador pools, leaderboards.
- [\$VICTORY Bonds/Tokens](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md)
  - Kickstart funding now; repay using treaty inflows and verified savings.

## Why Reallocate 1% (instead of “spend more on health”)?

- Moving the same small share (1%) together keeps the balance of power. No one falls behind; everyone gains cures.
- This moves real people and factories—not just paper budgets—toward health work.
- We avoid a new bureaucracy. Clear code + public data + verifiable oracles make decisions, with human overrides only for emergencies.

## Costs of War vs Disease (Context)

## What You Can Do Now

- [Sign the global referendum](./referendum/global-referendum-implementation.md) and get counted in a verifiable tally.
- [Get your referral link](./referral-rewards-system.md) to help reach the [3.5% tipping point](mdc:https:/www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world) with jackpots and leaderboards.
- [Fund the war on disease](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md) via \$VICTORY instruments.
- [Build and earn](./open-ecosystem-and-bounty-model.md) with bounties, prizes, and merge-to-earn.
- [Join or found an institute](./1-percent-treaty/institute-charter-template.md) under the DIH umbrella.

## Guarantees and Guardrails

- Automated-by-default execution with public rules; emergency-only DAO overrides with strict sunsets.
- Verifiable oracles for evidence, safety, identity/COI, and savings; immutable logs replace reports.
- Safety circuit-breakers and clawbacks; transparent audits funded by bounties.
