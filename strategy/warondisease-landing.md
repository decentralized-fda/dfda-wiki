# War is fucking stupid. Diseases suck.

# But governments spend 40X more on militarism than finding cures for diseases.

---

## The Simple Truth

Governments spend **[$2.72 trillion](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2025/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2024)** on military and **[\$67.5 billion](../reference/global-government-medical-research-spending.md)** on finding cures for diseases.

People like Jesus realized that loving people is preferable to murdering them millennia ago. However, despite general agreement on this point, absolutely nothing has worked to counter this continual grotesque misallocation of resources.

Every year, the disparity gets worse and worse.

We literally haven't cured a single damn disease for nearly 50 years.

**The current system is actively getting worse:** Recent budget proposals globally continue the grotesque misallocation - military spending increases while health research budgets are slashed. This isn't a partisan issue or limited to any single country; it's a systemic global failure that spans nations and political parties. The pattern is clear: more weapons, less health research, more death.

In our evolutionary past, a world with scarce resources, violence was necessary for survival. But today we live in a world with enough food for everyone.  In fact, nearly all starvation today is actually the RESULT of violent conflict.

Another notable difference, is that we're currently spending billions on autonomous AI weapons systems and have enough nuclear weapons to kill all of humanity at least 13 times and then shake the rubble.

So humanity has 2 paths:
1. Keep acting like violent dumbass monkeys until we extinct ourselves with a Terminator Skynet or nuclear catastrophe
2. Bribe the hell out of everyone to act like a rational proper species for once

Which do you want?


---

## Here's How We Fix It:

**Step 1:** Pay people \$0.20 for each person who votes on a global referendum via their link.

**Step 2:** When we hit [3.5% of humanity](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), we have proof the world wants this.

**Step 3:** Build a legal political engine: independent‑expenditure committees (Super PACs and international equivalents) that pledge massive support for candidates who vote with their district’s referendum result—and fund challengers against those who defy it (no coordination).

**Step 4:** The treasury funds EVERYONE in health - universities, pharma, nonprofits, government agencies - through democratically controlled funding pools.

---

## Why This Works

**Human nature unchanged:** People respond to incentives. We make the right choice profitable.

**Power follows money:** When healing pays better than killing, power shifts to healers.

**Safety in numbers:** All nations move 1% together. No one gains advantage or loses ground.

The strategic risk of non-compliance by some nations is minimal. Global military spending is already highly asymmetric; a 1% budget shift does not materially alter the balance of power.

The Pentagon cannot account for **[$2.5 trillion in assets](https://thecommunemag.com/the-pentagon-misplaced-2-46-trillion-an-in-depth-look-at-the-financial-audit-failures)**. The U.S. contribution to this plan is **$10 billion per year**. We are asking to redirect an amount equal to **0.4%** of the money they have already lost.

**Proof before action:** The referendum shows the world's will before any nation commits.

**Existing institutions win:** Universities, hospitals, research centers—all receive more funding than ever before.

---

## Why This Approach?

**1. "Why not just rely on philanthropy?"**

Relying on donations would force us to compete with the very ecosystem we aim to support. Philanthropy is a finite, zero-sum game. A massive fundraising campaign for the DIH would inevitably cannibalize the existing pool of donations, effectively stealing funds from the thousands of vital health charities already doing critical work. This would harm the cause, not help it.

Our goal is not to reshuffle a small pot of charitable giving. It is to tap into the multi-trillion dollar firehose of government spending.

Furthermore, philanthropy treats the symptoms of a broken system. It doesn't change the underlying political-economic incentives that perpetuate the problem. We are not just trying to fund more research; we are trying to permanently shift the global allocation of capital and talent from destruction to creation. Only a systemic reallocation can achieve that.

**2. "Why redirect military spending? Why not just increase the health budget?"**

This is not about nominal dollar figures; it is about the **real allocation of a finite pie of resources**. The world's top scientists, engineers, and manufacturing capacity are a limited resource. What matters is not the absolute dollar amount spent on health, but the *percentage* of our collective talent and capital dedicated to it, as this is the true surrogate for resource allocation.

If we simply "increase health spending" by 10% through new appropriations, but the central bank also expands the money supply and the military budget grows by 10%, **no real resources have been shifted**. It's an inflationary wash. The same scientists and factories will continue to build weapons because that's where the larger share of the economic pie remains.

A **direct, treaty-bound reallocation** is the only mechanism that forces a true shift of these finite resources. By cutting 1% from military budgets, we are not just moving dollars; we are freeing up the physicists, data scientists, and supply chains that were serving the military-industrial complex and making them available to cure Alzheimer's. This is how you change the game.

## Why 1% Less Military = More Security

**Modern weapons make everyone less safe:**
- Nuclear weapons: [1% fewer = ~120 fewer nukes worldwide](https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/)
- AI weapons systems: Reduce global AI arms race escalation  
- Cyber warfare tools: Less proliferation of attack capabilities

**Real security threats are health-based:**
- [Pandemics kill more people than wars](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) (COVID-19: 7M+ deaths vs. annual conflict deaths ~100K)
- Antibiotic resistance could kill [10M/year by 2050](https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/160525_Final%20paper_with%20cover.pdf)
- [Mental health crises destabilize societies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders) more than foreign armies

**1% reallocation = stronger nations:**
- Healthier populations are more productive
- Medical breakthroughs boost economic competitiveness
- Reduced healthcare costs free up MORE budget for defense if needed

### The Ultimate Failsafe: The Worst-Case Scenario is Still a Win

Even if the Decentralized Institutes of Health were a completely inefficient failure and dumped every single dollar into the ocean, the world would *still* be better off.

Why?

Because we would still have **1% fewer nuclear weapons**. We would still have a **1% slower AI arms race**. We would still have a **1% reduction in the global capacity for organized violence.**

The worst possible outcome of this plan—total waste—is still a net gain for global security. The best possible outcome is that we also cure cancer.

## Why Good Intentions Have Failed

For centuries, we've known war brings suffering. Yet we fund it anyway.

Why?
- Defense contractors earn billions
- Politicians receive generous donations  
- The cycle continues
- The Pentagon [literally lost \$2.5 trillion](https://thecommunemag.com/the-pentagon-misplaced-2-46-trillion-an-in-depth-look-at-the-financial-audit-failures) and can't explain where it went

The scale of this financial mismanagement provides perspective. The value of these unaccounted-for assets is equivalent to 37 years of global medical research funding. The proposed 1% redirection is insignificant compared to the sums already being lost to systemic waste and a lack of basic accountability.

**The current system is actively cutting health research:** Recent budget proposals globally continue cutting health research while increasing military spending. This is the grotesque misallocation in real-time - we're not just failing to fund cures, we're actively defunding them to buy more weapons. The pattern spans administrations, parties, and nations worldwide.

## Our Answer

We will not defeat money with morals. We will defeat bad money with better money.

**Their system rewards death:**
- Defense contractors: [$10 billion contracts](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262742/countries-with-the-highest-military-spending/)
- Politicians: [$100+ million in lobbying annually](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/news/2022/defense-sector-spent-101-million-lobbying-during-first-three-quarters-2022)
- Result: More weapons, less security

**Our system rewards life:**
- Citizens: Paid for each referendum vote they generate  
- Organizations: Partner referral rewards for verified votes via your org’s link; tiered bonus pools and leaderboards for coalitions
- Politicians: Backed with independent expenditures when they vote with their district’s referendum result

- Institutions: Double or triple their research funding

We choose to make saving lives more profitable than taking them.

## The Political Economics

**Defense contractors' lobbying ROI:**
- [$1.1 billion lobbying](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/news/2022/defense-sector-spent-101-million-lobbying-during-first-three-quarters-2022) (2001-2021) → [$2.02 trillion contracts](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/09/02/top-defense-firms-see-2t-return-on-1b-investment-in-afghan-war/)
- **Return: \$1,813 per \$1 spent on lobbying**

**What we're asking politicians to redirect:**
- 1% of \$2.72T = **\$27 billion annually** in military contracts
- Defense contractors would spend ~**\$15 million in lobbying** to defend that revenue

**Our counter-offer to politicians (legal and effective):**
- Independent expenditures for campaigns: Massive ad buys and ground game support for candidates who vote with their district’s verified referendum tally; equivalent spending against those who defy it (no coordination).
- Voter coalition: The [3.5%](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world) public mandate provides electoral cover.


**The math:** We outbid defense contractors on expected electoral value while delivering massive health benefits to constituents.

---

## Why This Isn't Completely Insane

With regard to difficulty and complexity, it doesn't matter. The alternative is death, disease, and possible human extinction. We already have a proof of concept that shows this works in a fossil fuel industry that receives \$7T in subsidies every year.

**1. "This sounds like a cynical, illegal bribe. You'll have no soul."**

*   **Reality:** The old system of "legal" lobbying is just a slow, inefficient bribe that produces war and disease. The new system is a transparent, efficient bribe that produces peace and health. In a world where political leaders successfully fund campaigns with their own crypto tokens and sell access to exclusive events, the line between a "donation" and an "investment in a political outcome" has already been erased. We are simply applying that new reality to a goal that benefits all of humanity. Our soul is in the outcome: saving millions of lives.

**2. "A global referendum is not a real protest. It's a flawed analogy."**

*   **Reality:** A cryptographically secure, on-chain list of 280 million verified supporters is not an "analogy"; it is the largest, most powerful political mandate in human history. It is a direct threat to the power of traditional media and captured political parties. It is a political entity in its own right, capable of swinging elections and forcing change. Clicks on a screen are the new boots on the ground.

**3. "A government's promise to pay is unenforceable. This is a fantasy."**

*   **Reality:** Legal enforceability is a relic of a court-based system. Financial enforceability is what matters now. In a world of global capital markets, a sovereign nation defaulting on a treaty obligation backed by the world's most powerful investors is unthinkable. The financial cost of being blacklisted would be far greater than the 1% redirection. The "full faith and credit" of the global elite is a stronger guarantee than any court ruling.

**4. "This is too operationally complex to build."**

*   **Reality:** The complexity is the moat. Building a trustless, global-scale system for political action is difficult, but it is no more difficult than building the autonomous weapons systems currently being funded. The difference is that our platform is designed to build consensus and unlock human potential, not to create more efficient ways to kill.

**5. "This is politically impossible - you can't just redirect military budgets by referendum"**

*   **Reality:** Military budgets are redirected all the time through political pressure. The question isn't whether it's possible, but whether we can generate enough pressure. The \$7T fossil fuel subsidy proof-of-concept shows that massive economic reallocation is achievable when the right incentives align. We're not asking for unilateral disarmament - we're asking all nations to move 1% together, maintaining relative power balances.

**6. "You're assuming governments will honor treaty commitments when they don't honor existing ones"**

*   **Reality:** Existing treaties fail because they lack enforcement mechanisms. Our system creates financial enforcement through global capital markets - a nation that defaults faces immediate economic consequences far greater than the 1% redirection. The "full faith and credit" of global investors is more reliable than international courts that have no real power.

**7. "The 3.5% rule applies to civil resistance movements, not global online referendums"**

*   **Reality:** The 3.5% rule demonstrates that mass participation creates political legitimacy. Online participation translates to real political pressure when it's verifiable, permanent, and tied to electoral consequences. A cryptographically secure list of 280 million verified supporters becomes a political entity that candidates must respect or face electoral consequences.

**8. "Independent expenditures don't work against entrenched incumbents with deep pockets"**

*   **Reality:** Independent expenditures work when they're massive and targeted. We're not competing dollar-for-dollar with defense contractors - we're creating a system where supporting the treaty becomes the politically safer choice than opposing it. When 3.5% of humanity has voted for this, opposing it becomes electoral suicide.

**9. "You're competing with defense contractors who have decades of relationships and influence"**

*   **Reality:** Defense contractors have influence because they deliver votes and money. We're creating a system that delivers more votes and more money to politicians who support the treaty. The relationships follow the power - when healing becomes more profitable than killing, the political class will adapt. We're not fighting the existing system; we're making it work for us.

**10. "How do you prevent waste and ensure the money actually helps patients?"**

*   **Reality:** The decentralized FDA uses [decentralized pragmatic trials that cost $500 per patient vs. $41,000 traditional trials](../reference/recovery-trial.md) - an 80X efficiency improvement proven by the Oxford RECOVERY trial. Compare this to the NIH RECOVER initiative: $1.6B budget, $53,333 per patient, zero completed trials in 4 years. With the same $1.6B budget, the dFDA could run 2,800 trials enrolling 2.8 million patients vs. NIH's zero completed trials.

**11. "How does this help patients vs. just funding more bureaucracy?"**

*   **Reality:** The decentralized FDA puts money directly into patients' hands through algorithmic subsidy allocation that maximizes QALYs gained per dollar, disease burden, and patient financial need. Unlike traditional NIH grants that fund institutions based on political connections, this ensures trials happen where the health impact is highest. Patients get subsidized access to cutting-edge treatments while contributing to research that benefits everyone.

**12. "What's the proof this works better than current NIH funding?"**

*   **Reality:** The Oxford RECOVERY trial saved over 1 million lives globally at $500 per patient. The NIH RECOVER initiative spent $53,333 per patient and completed zero trials in 4 years. The dFDA's algorithmic subsidy allocation would have funded 3,200 RECOVERY-style trials with the same budget that NIH used to complete zero trials. The evidence is overwhelming: decentralized pragmatic trials deliver 80X more patients treated per dollar spent.

## Investment Required vs. Returns

**Total Implementation Cost:** \$1.2-2.5B over 36 months

**What This Buys:**
- Global referendum platform (\$56M for 280M signatures at \$0.20 each)
- Independent expenditures in priority elections (\$800M-1.5B)
- Platform development and pilot programs (\$250-400M Phase 1)
- Legal compliance and treaty framework (\$100-200M)

**Annual Returns Once Operational:** \$27B+ per year from 1% military budget redirections

**ROI Timeline:** 18-36 months after first treaty ratification

**Break-even Analysis:** Even if only 5 major countries participate (US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada), that's \$8.5B annually vs. \$2.5B total investment = 3.4X return in year one alone.

**The Math:** We're asking for \$2.5B to redirect \$27B annually. That's a 10:1 return ratio - better than most venture capital investments, except this one saves millions of lives.

## Activation Energy Sequence: Who We Bribe First

**Phase 1: Seed Investors (\$250-400M Initial Investment)**
- **Who:** Wealthy individuals, funds, crypto whales
- **Bribe:** 
  - Dynamic interest rates: 8-12% base + success multipliers
  - \$VICTORY governance tokens controlling \$27B annual DIH treasury
  - If we achieve fossil fuel industry's >100X lobbying ROI, investors get a cut
- **Why they bite:** Control over \$27B/year health treasury through governance tokens = massive ongoing influence + returns that dwarf any alternative investment

**Phase 2: \$VICTORY Token Buyers (\$100-200M Referendum Funding)**
- **Who:** Crypto investors, health advocates, institutions
- **Bribe:**
  - \$VICTORY tokens that govern DIH DAO decisions on \$27B annually
  - Vote on patient subsidies (popular causes = higher token demand)
  - Vote on grants/contracts (direct funds to their preferred projects)
  - Token appreciation as treasury grows from \$0 → \$27B
- **Why they bite:** Early governance control of the world's largest decentralized health funding mechanism

**Phase 3: Citizens (\$56M for 280M Referendum Votes)**
- **Who:** Global population (targeting 3.5% = 280M people)
- **Bribe:** \$0.20 per referendum vote (funded by \$VICTORY token sales)
- **Why they bite:** Easy money + moral satisfaction + they want better healthcare

**Phase 4: Politicians (\$800M-1.5B Independent Expenditures)**
- **Who:** Key legislators in target countries
- **Bribe:** Massive campaign support for treaty supporters, equivalent opposition funding for defectors
- **Why they bite:** 280M verified voters + overwhelming campaign funding vs. defense contractors' \$15M lobbying budget

**The Compounding Effect:** Each phase funds the next. Seed investors control governance of \$27B treasury. Token buyers fund the referendum. Citizens create electoral pressure. Politicians pass treaties. Everyone gets paid more than they could anywhere else.

---

## Referendums vs Independent Expenditures

- **Referendums (where binding and timely):** Highest legitimacy; durable mandate; use when national or state mechanisms exist and timelines are practical.
- **Advisory signals (where no referendum):** Run scientifically credible polling or representative citizen assemblies; publish verified tallies per district.
- **Independent expenditures:** Fastest lever to translate district will into votes; pledge support for lawmakers who vote with their district’s verified result (and oppose those who defy it), with strict no‑coordination.
- **Hybrid playbook:** Use the global referendum for umbrella mandate; use country/district signals to direct lawful independent expenditures.

## Legal Compliance (jurisdiction‑specific)

- **United States:** Use independent‑expenditure committees (Super PACs). No coordination with campaigns; comply with FEC reporting and disclaimer rules; respect the foreign‑national ban (funds and decision‑making must be from U.S. persons for U.S. elections) [FEC guidance](https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/).
- **EU/UK/Canada/Japan and others:** Use lawful local equivalents (third‑party campaigners, non‑party campaigners, PACs). Separate, jurisdiction‑specific entities; local counsel review; segregated banking and governance.
- **No quid‑pro‑quo contracts:** No smart‑contract triggers tied to legislative votes. Rewards are independent expenditures based on public, verified district will.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

**Cheating/Holdouts:** Start with coalitions of willing nations; create competitive pressure and trade incentives for laggards.

**Capture/Corruption:** Transparent, algorithmic allocation based on verifiable health outcomes; independent audits funded by bounties.

**Legal Challenges:** Multi-jurisdiction compliance from Day 1; constitutional scholars on advisory board; structured as treaty obligations, not domestic mandates.

**Timeline Risk:** Phased approach with clear gates; early wins in smaller countries build momentum for major powers.

---

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Build global referendum platform; secure initial \$250M financing tranche; launch in 5 pilot countries.

**Phase 2 (Months 12-24):** Achieve 3.5% global participation; begin independent expenditures in priority elections; first binding referendum votes.

**Phase 3 (Months 24-36):** Secure first national treaty commitments; establish DIH treasury operations; begin institutional funding.

**Phase 4 (Months 36-48):** Scale to major powers (US, EU, China); achieve \$27B+ annual inflows; full operational deployment.

**Phase 5 (Years 4-5):** Evaluate expansion beyond 1%; measure health outcomes; consider additional global challenges.

**Key Gates:** 100M referendum participants → first \$500M independent expenditure cycle → first treaty ratification → first \$1B disbursement.

---

## Financing Structure (For Investors)

**Total Capital Need:** \$1.2-2.5B over 36 months, deployable in tranches tied to achievement gates.

**Victory Notes (Senior, 60% of capital):** 6-9% coupon post-treaty commitments; secured by assigned government receivables; 3-5 year tenor.

**Mezzanine (30% of capital):** 12-16% target IRR; step-up coupons on delays; performance kickers tied to verified savings.

**First-Loss/Guarantee (10% of capital):** Philanthropic/PRI capital at 0-5% to de-risk senior tranches; absorbs political/execution risk.

**Phase 1 Requirement:** \$250-400M for global platform, pilot countries, and first electoral cycles. Senior/mezz investors enter at higher yields (10-20%) until binding government commitments de-risk the structure.

**Repayment Source:** Assigned 1% military budget redirections from participating governments; estimated \$27B+ annual once operational.

---

## The Treasury Model

**[\$VICTORY Bonds](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):** Bootstrap funding now, repaid by treaty inflows.

**[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md):** Democratic treasury that funds specialized programs for each health area.

**Specialized programs fund existing institutions:** 
- Decentralized Institute of Mental Health → funds universities, pharma, nonprofits working on depression, anxiety, etc.
- Decentralized Institute of Cancer Research → funds MD Anderson, pharmaceutical companies, patient advocacy groups
- Decentralized Institute of Aging → funds longevity research at every institution

**Everyone gets more money. No one gets displaced.**
