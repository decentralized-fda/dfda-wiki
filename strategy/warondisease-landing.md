# A species that spends twenty times more on weapons than cures has lost its mind.

# The time has come to fix this madness.

---

## The Simple Truth

Every year, humanity spends **[\$2.72 trillion](https:/www.sipri.org/publications/2025/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2024)** preparing for war and **\$120 billion** curing disease.

We have chosen to fund death over life by a ratio of 20 to 1.

This is not strategy. This is insanity.

---

## The Solution

**Step 1:** Pay people \$0.20 for each person who votes on a global referendum via their link.

**Step 2:** When we hit [3.5% of humanity](https:/www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), we have proof the world wants this.

**Step 3:** Build a legal political engine: independent‑expenditure committees (Super PACs and international equivalents) that pledge massive support for candidates who vote with their district’s referendum result—and fund challengers against those who defy it (no coordination).

**Step 4:** The treasury funds EVERYONE in health - universities, pharma, nonprofits, government agencies - through democratically controlled funding pools.

---

## Why This Works

**Human nature unchanged:** People respond to incentives. We make the right choice profitable.

**Power follows money:** When healing pays better than killing, power shifts to healers.

**Safety in numbers:** All nations move 1% together. No one gains advantage or loses ground. National security increases via 1% fewer nuclear weapons and a slower autonomous‑weapons arms race.

**Proof before action:** The referendum shows the world's will before any nation commits.

**Existing institutions win:** Universities, hospitals, research centers—all receive more funding than ever before.

## Why 1% Less Military = More Security

**Modern weapons make everyone less safe:**
- Nuclear weapons: [1% fewer = ~134 fewer nukes worldwide](https:/fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/)
- AI weapons systems: Reduce global AI arms race escalation  
- Cyber warfare tools: Less proliferation of attack capabilities

**Real security threats are health-based:**
- Pandemics kill more people than wars
- Antibiotic resistance could kill [10M/year by 2050](https:/amr-review.org/sites/default/files/160525_Final%20paper_with%20cover.pdf)
- Mental health crises destabilize societies more than foreign armies

**1% reallocation = stronger nations:**
- Healthier populations are more productive
- Medical breakthroughs boost economic competitiveness
- Reduced healthcare costs free up MORE budget for defense if needed

## Why Good Intentions Have Failed

For centuries, we have known war brings suffering. Yet we fund it anyway.

Why? Because those who profit from war pay handsomely for the privilege. Defense contractors earn billions. Politicians receive generous donations. The cycle continues.

Good intentions cannot compete with gold.

## Our Answer

We will not defeat money with morals. We will defeat bad money with better money.

**Their system rewards death:**
- Defense contractors: [\$10 billion contracts](https:/www.statista.com/statistics/262742/countries-with-the-highest-military-spending/)
- Politicians: [\$100+ million in lobbying annually](https:/watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/news/2022/defense-sector-spent-101-million-lobbying-during-first-three-quarters-2022)
- Result: More weapons, less security

**Our system rewards life:**
- Citizens: Paid for each referendum vote they generate  
- Organizations: Partner referral rewards for verified votes via your org’s link; tiered jackpots and leaderboards for coalitions
- Politicians: Backed with independent expenditures when they vote with their district’s referendum result
- Stronger national security: 1% fewer nukes and slower AI‑weapons escalation; deterrence preserved because everyone moves 1% together
- Institutions: Double or triple their research funding

We choose to make saving lives more profitable than taking them.

## The Political Economics

**Defense contractors' lobbying ROI:**
- [\$1.1 billion lobbying](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/news/2022/defense-sector-spent-101-million-lobbying-during-first-three-quarters-2022) (2001-2021) → [\$2.02 trillion contracts](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/09/02/top-defense-firms-see-2t-return-on-1b-investment-in-afghan-war/)
- **Return: \$1,813 per \$1 spent on lobbying**

**What we're asking politicians to redirect:**
- 1% of \$2.72T = **\$27 billion annually** in military contracts
- Defense contractors would spend ~**\$15 million in lobbying** to defend that revenue

**Our counter-offer to politicians (legal and effective):**
- Independent expenditures for campaigns: Massive ad buys and ground game support for candidates who vote with their district’s verified referendum tally; equivalent spending against those who defy it (no coordination).
- Voter coalition: The [3.5%](https:/www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world) public mandate provides electoral cover.
- National security increases: 1% fewer nuclear weapons and slower AI‑weapons escalation; deterrence preserved because everyone moves 1% together.

**The math:** We outbid defense contractors on expected electoral value while delivering massive health benefits to constituents.

## Referendums vs Independent Expenditures

- **Referendums (where binding and timely):** Highest legitimacy; durable mandate; use when national or state mechanisms exist and timelines are practical.
- **Advisory signals (where no referendum):** Run scientifically credible polling or representative citizen assemblies; publish verified tallies per district.
- **Independent expenditures:** Fastest lever to translate district will into votes; pledge support for lawmakers who vote with their district’s verified result (and oppose those who defy it), with strict no‑coordination.
- **Hybrid playbook:** Use the global referendum for umbrella mandate; use country/district signals to direct lawful independent expenditures.

## Legal Compliance (jurisdiction‑specific)

- **United States:** Use independent‑expenditure committees (Super PACs). No coordination with campaigns; comply with FEC reporting and disclaimer rules; respect the foreign‑national ban (funds and decision‑making must be from U.S. persons for U.S. elections) [FEC guidance](https:/www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/).
- **EU/UK/Canada/Japan and others:** Use lawful local equivalents (third‑party campaigners, non‑party campaigners, PACs). Separate, jurisdiction‑specific entities; local counsel review; segregated banking and governance.
- **No quid‑pro‑quo contracts:** No smart‑contract triggers tied to legislative votes. Rewards are independent expenditures based on public, verified district will.

## The Treasury Model

**[\$VICTORY Bonds](./1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):** Bootstrap funding now, repaid by treaty inflows.

**[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md):** Democratic treasury that funds specialized programs for each health area.

**Specialized programs fund existing institutions:** 
- Decentralized Institute of Mental Health → funds universities, pharma, nonprofits working on depression, anxiety, etc.
- Decentralized Institute of Cancer Research → funds MD Anderson, pharmaceutical companies, patient advocacy groups
- Decentralized Institute of Aging → funds longevity research at every institution

**Everyone gets more money. No one gets displaced.**

## For Institutions

**Pharmaceutical companies:** Get 2-5X more R&D funding for the same work.

**Universities:** Massive increase in research grants across all health departments.

**Patient advocacy groups:** Direct funding for your cause areas.

**Government health agencies:** Expanded budgets without fighting for appropriations.

**Contact us:** [institutions@warondisease.org](mailto:institutions@warondisease.org) to calculate your potential funding increase.

## The Math

**[3.5% of humanity](https:/www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world) = ~280 million people**

**\$0.20 × 280 million = \$56 million** to create overwhelming public mandate

**\$56 million vs [\$27 billion/year](https:/www.sipri.org/publications/2025/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2024)** = 480X return on initial referendum investment

**Result:** Every health institution gets 2-5X more funding. Forever.
