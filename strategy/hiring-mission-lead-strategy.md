# Operation Wartime General: A Strategy for Recruiting a Founding Lead

## Executive Summary

We are not filling a job vacancy. We are seeding a new organization. With an initial grant of $60,000 from lifespan.io, our objective is to find and empower a "Wartime General"—a unique individual with the profile of a CEO/CTO—to lead a new front in the War on Disease.

This person's mandate is clear: within the initial runway provided by the grant, they must create a self-sustaining entity. This means either **building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that secures a key partner or initial users,** or **raising the next round of funding** to continue the mission and expand the team.

This document outlines the strategy for identifying, vetting, and activating this leader.

## Part 1: The Founder Profile - Who We Are Looking For

We are searching for a rare combination of technical mastery, strategic vision, and relentless drive. This is not a role for a pure manager or a pure coder.

**Key Attributes:**

1.  **A Product-Minded Builder:** They must be a highly competent engineer capable of building the initial product themselves. Crucially, they don't just build what's asked; they can identify a high-value problem for a specific user (e.g., researchers, patients) and build the leanest possible solution to solve it.
2.  **A Pragmatic Fundraiser:** They must be able to articulate a compelling vision that inspires investment. This doesn't necessarily mean a slick salesperson, but someone who can clearly explain the problem, the solution, and the plan to investors, donors, and partners.
3.  **An Evangelical Communicator:** The "War on Disease" needs a storyteller. They must be able to write and speak with passion and clarity, capable of recruiting future employees, inspiring volunteers, and converting skeptics.
4.  **Deeply Mission-Aligned:** This cannot be just a "job." The ideal candidate will see this as their life's work. They are likely already active or deeply interested in longevity, open-source science, or health-tech. They must have the resilience to pursue a monumental goal with limited initial resources.

## Part 2: The Recruitment & Selection Strategy

This role cannot be filled through job boards. It requires a targeted, outbound search.

**Step 1: The Prospect List (Where to Hunt)**

We must actively seek out talent from high-signal environments:
- **Founders of Related Startups:** Look for founders of acquired or failed startups in health-tech, biotech, or data science (e.g., via YCombinator's alumni list). They have proven experience in both building and fundraising.
- **Top Open-Source Contributors:** Identify the key individuals behind open-source projects relevant to our mission (e.g., bioinformatics tools, decentralized identity projects, data analysis libraries). Their work is public and proven.
- **Hackathon Winners & Organizers:** Find the leaders of winning teams from recent, relevant hackathons (e.g., health-tech, AI for science).
- **Leaders from Adjacent Crusades:** Look for talent in movements with a similar ethos, such as leaders in the Effective Altruism or Decentralized Science (DeSci) communities.

**Step 2: The Outreach (The Call to Arms)**

Your outreach must be personal, respectful, and framed as a call to lead a mission, not apply for a job.
- **Subject:** A mission to fight disease
- **Body:** "Hi [Name], I'm reaching out because I was incredibly impressed by your work on [Specific Project]. The way you [Specific Accomplishment] demonstrates a rare ability to [Skill]. We are looking for a founding leader to spearhead a new, well-funded initiative to accelerate the War on Disease. Given your background, I believe you could be the right general to lead this charge. Would you be open to a brief, confidential conversation about the mission?"

**Step 3: The "Interview" - A Mutual Due Diligence Process**

The goal is to determine if there is a mutual fit for a founder-level role.
1.  **The Mission Deep Dive (Call 1):** A conversation about the vision. Does it resonate with them on a deep level?
2.  **The Strategy Session (Call 2):** They present *their* initial thoughts on how they would approach the first 90 days. How do they think? Are their ideas concrete?
3.  **The Collaborative Plan (Final Stage):** The final "interview" is a 2-hour working session where you and the candidate **co-author the 90-day mandate document together.** This is the ultimate test of collaboration, strategic alignment, and whether you can build a shared vision. If this session is successful, you have found your leader.

## Part 3: The Offer & The Mandate (The 90-Day War Plan)

This section details the terms of engagement.

**The Offer:**
- **Title:** Founding Engineer & Mission Lead.
- **Compensation:** A $60,000 "Founder's Grant" to provide runway for an initial 4-6 month period. This is not a salary; it is seed funding.
- **Incentive:** A significant equity stake in the legal entity to be formed (e.g., a C-Corp or a foundation's subsidiary). This ensures they are a true owner of the mission's success.

**The 90-Day Mandate:**
Upon accepting, the Mission Lead's sole focus is to achieve one of the following two success conditions within the runway period to unlock the next phase of funding and hiring.

*   **Path A: The Builder's Proof-of-Concept**
    - **Objective:** Build and launch an MVP that gains tangible, early traction.
    - **Key Actions:**
        1.  Identify a hyper-specific user (e.g., Alzheimer's researchers at a specific institution).
        2.  Build a tool that solves one of their critical problems (e.g., a platform for aggregating and visualizing biomarker data from disparate sources).
        3.  Launch the tool and secure a written commitment from at least one flagship user or partner to integrate it into their workflow.
    - **Success Unlocks:** The demonstrated traction is used to raise a formal seed round to hire engineers #2 and #3.

*   **Path B: The Fundraiser's Seed Round**
    - **Objective:** Secure the financial resources to build the team and execute the vision.
    - **Key Actions:**
        1.  Develop a compelling narrative, pitch deck, and operational plan.
        2.  Build a minimal "demo" or prototype that illustrates the core concept.
        3.  Secure at least $250,000 in funding commitments (from VCs, philanthropic foundations, DAOs, etc.).
    - **Success Unlocks:** The new capital is used to hire engineers #2 and #3 and begin executing the product roadmap.

The chosen path will depend on the Mission Lead's background and strategic judgment. The outcome, however, is the same: creating a self-sustaining organization ready to wage a real War on Disease.
