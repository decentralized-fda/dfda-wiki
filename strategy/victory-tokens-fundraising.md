# üèÖ $VICTORY Tokens: Modern Fundraising for Medical Progress

## Why $VICTORY Tokens?
- Inspired by WWII war bonds, $VICTORY tokens are a digital, transparent way to fund the movement for 80X faster medical progress.
- Purpose: Directly finance the viral [referral-rewards system](./referral-rewards-system.md) to mobilize 3.5% of the population for the [FDA Upgrade & Right to Trial Act](../features/fda-upgrade-act.md).
- Goal: Unlock the same scale of transformation as the Oxford RECOVERY trial, which achieved an [80X efficiency gain](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) in clinical research.

## How It Works
- **Purchase $VICTORY tokens** to fund verified votes and actions in support of the Act.
- **Each token** directly funds a specific number of verified votes (target: <$1 per vote, with potential for $0.20‚Äì$0.30 in viral scenarios‚Äîsee [cost benchmarks](https://www.everylibrary.org/)).
- **All transactions** are transparently tracked on-chain, with a public dashboard showing progress toward the 3.5% tipping point ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)).

## Incentives for Supporters
- **Share in future healthcare savings** or referral jackpots, aligning incentives with campaign success.
- **Governance rights**: Token holders may help steer campaign direction and reward distribution.
- **Recognition**: Top contributors featured on leaderboards and in campaign updates.

## Transparency & Accountability
- **Open, auditable records** of all token sales and reward distributions.
- **Real-time impact dashboard**: See how many votes/actions your support has funded.
- **Economic model**: "Every $1,000 in $VICTORY tokens funds 1,000+ verified votes, unlocking $X in healthcare savings and Y lives improved."

## Why This Matters
- **Replicating RECOVERY's 80X efficiency** would allow the U.S. to run 80 times more trials for the same budget ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)).
- Mobilizing 3.5% of the population with referral rewards can create the political will to pass the Act, unlocking these savings for all diseases.
- **Potential: Save millions of lives, cut drug development costs by 95%, and accelerate cures for rare and common diseases alike."
