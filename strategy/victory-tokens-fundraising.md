## Why $VICTORY Tokens?
- Inspired by WWII war bonds, $VICTORY tokens are a digital, transparent way to fund the movement for 80X faster medical progress.
- Purpose: Directly finance the viral [referral-rewards system](./referral-rewards-system.md) to mobilize 3.5% of the population for the [FDA Upgrade & Right to Trial Act](../features/fda-upgrade-act.md).
- Goal: Unlock the same scale of transformation as the Oxford RECOVERY trial, which achieved an [80X efficiency gain](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) in clinical research.

## How It Works
- **Purchase $VICTORY tokens** to fund verified votes and actions in support of the Act.
- **Each token** directly funds a specific number of verified votes (target: <$1 per vote, with potential for $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios—see [cost benchmarks](https://www.everylibrary.org/)).
- **All transactions** are transparently tracked on-chain, with a public dashboard showing progress toward the 3.5% tipping point ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)).

| **Change.org "Promoted Petitions"** (internal help-page math) | Paid distribution that generates incremental signatures | Change.org charges **about \$0.30 per 1 000 ad impressions**; typical signature-conversion rates quoted in user analyses put the **effective cost at \$0.20–\$0.40 per added signature** | ([theguardian.com][2], [change.org][3]) |
| **U.S. ballot-initiative field collection** 2024 average      | *Wet-ink* legal signatures (much higher bar)            | **\$14.87 per signature** – shows how expensive the old model is                                                                                                                         | ([ballotpedia.org][4])                  |


## Incentives for Supporters
- **Share in future healthcare savings** or referral jackpots, aligning incentives with campaign success.
- **Governance rights**: Token holders may help steer campaign direction and reward distribution.
- **Recognition**: Top contributors featured on leaderboards and in campaign updates.

## Transparency & Accountability
- **Open, auditable records** of all token sales and reward distributions.
- **Real-time impact dashboard**: See how many votes/actions your support has funded.
- **Economic model**: "Every $1,000 in $VICTORY tokens funds 1,000+ verified votes, unlocking $X in healthcare savings and Y lives improved."
- **References**: [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/), [3.5% rule for social change](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world).

## Why This Matters
- **Replicating RECOVERY's 80X efficiency** would allow the U.S. to run 80 times more trials for the same budget ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)).
- Mobilizing 3.5% of the population with referral rewards can create the political will to pass the Act, unlocking these savings for all diseases.
- **Potential: Save millions of lives, cut drug development costs by 95%, and accelerate cures for rare and common diseases alike.

## Real-World Impact: How Public Support Drives Policy Change

Below are three well-documented cases where **large-scale, measurable public support translated into concrete policy change.** They illustrate different mechanisms—petitions, massive online comments, and sustained mobilization—so you can show Keith (or anyone) that *numbers really do move lawmakers* when the threshold is high enough.

| Case                                            | Scale of Support                                                                                                  | Immediate Trigger                                                                                                | Policy Outcome                                                                                                                 | Source                                                |

| **Non-violent movements 1900-2006 (Chenoweth)** | When \~**3.5 % of a population** participates actively, campaigns have **never failed** in the historical dataset | Sustained mass participation (boycotts, strikes, demonstrations)                                                 | Regime change or major policy concessions in >50 cases (e.g., Philippines 1986, Serbia 2000)                                   | ([news.harvard.edu][5], [nonviolent-conflict.org][6]) |

### Take-aways you can cite

1. **Digital advocacy ≠ empty clicks.**
   Net-neutrality's *4 million comments* and *100 k petition* directly preceded the FCC's strongest pro-consumer rule-making in decades.

2. **Formal thresholds matter.**
   In the UK system, **100 000 signers reliably buys parliamentary airtime**—a practical, repeatable path from signature to legislative debate.

3. **The 3.5 % rule is real.**
   Harvard's Erica Chenoweth shows that *active* engagement at that scale (≈ 12 M Americans) has been historically sufficient for transformative change every single time it's been reached.

So when you propose a pledge/ referral system that can gather tens of thousands—or eventually millions—of *district-mapped yes/no pledges*, you're standing on solid historical precedent: **big verified numbers force decision-makers to act.**
