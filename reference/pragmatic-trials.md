# Pragmatic vs Explanatory Trials: A Quantitative Analysis

## What are Pragmatic Trials?

Pragmatic trials are designed to test interventions in real-world conditions, focusing on:

- **Real-world effectiveness** rather than controlled efficacy
- **Broad patient populations** with minimal exclusion criteria
- **Routine clinical settings** rather than specialized research environments
- **Practical outcomes** that matter to patients and clinicians
- **Rapid implementation** of findings into clinical practice

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Metric | Pragmatic Trials (e.g., RECOVERY) | Traditional Explanatory Trials |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cost per Trial | Lower due to existing infrastructure | [$48-225 million](https://www.anjusoftware.com/insights/eclinical/clinical-trial-costs/) |
| Time to Results | Weeks to months | [5-7 years average](https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research) |
| Participants | Large (e.g., 47,000+ in RECOVERY) | Typically 500-3000 |
| Implementation Speed | Hours to days | Months to years |
| Patient Population | Diverse, real-world | Highly selected |
| Setting | Routine clinical practice | Specialized research centers |
| Generalizability | High | Limited |

## Cost Analysis

### Traditional Explanatory Trials
- Average phase costs ([source](https://www.sofpromed.com/how-much-does-a-clinical-trial-cost)):
  - Phase 1: $4 million
  - Phase 2: $13 million
  - Phase 3: $20 million
- Per-patient costs vary by therapeutic area:
  - Blood disorders: $200,000-422,000
  - Average across areas: $41,117

### Pragmatic Trials (RECOVERY Example)
- Utilized existing healthcare infrastructure
- Minimal additional staff costs
- Reduced monitoring costs
- Simple data collection systems
- Cost-effectiveness ratio significantly better than traditional trials

## Speed and Efficiency

### RECOVERY Trial Metrics
- 9 days: Concept to first patient enrollment
- 10 weeks: First life-saving treatment identified
- 3 hours: Results to policy implementation
- 47,000 participants across 6 countries
- 200+ hospital sites
- 10 major results obtained
- 4 effective COVID-19 treatments identified

### Traditional Trial Metrics
- Average time from phase 1 to approval: [7.2 years](https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/legacy/bioorg/docs/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf)
- [90% of traditional trials experience delays](https://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/)
- 80% fail to meet enrollment timelines

## Clinical Impact

### RECOVERY Trial
- Dexamethasone findings:
  - 35% reduction in mortality for ventilated patients
  - [Estimated 1 million lives saved globally](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/recovery-trial-one-year-on)
- Implementation within hours of results
- Real-world effectiveness immediately apparent

### Traditional Trials
- [14% success rate from phase 1 to approval](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/)
- Average 7 years from discovery to clinical practice
- Limited real-world applicability due to strict inclusion criteria

## Advantages of Pragmatic Trials

1. **Better Generalizability**
   - Results apply to broader patient populations
   - Findings directly relevant to routine clinical practice
   - Higher external validity

2. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Uses existing healthcare infrastructure
   - Lower per-patient costs
   - Faster recruitment and completion

3. **Implementation Speed**
   - Rapid translation to clinical practice
   - Immediate real-world validation
   - Reduced lag between evidence and practice

4. **Statistical Power**
   - Larger sample sizes possible
   - More diverse patient populations
   - Better representation of real-world outcomes
