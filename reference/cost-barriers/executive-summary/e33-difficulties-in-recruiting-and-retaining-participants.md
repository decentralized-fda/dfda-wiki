### E.3.3 Difficulties in Recruiting and Retaining Participants

- Patient recruitment requires a substantial investment of time and money.
- Failure to recruit can cause costly delays or trial cancellation, wasting resources.
- There is competition for limited patient pools for certain conditions, such as rare cancers and multiple sclerosis.
- Clinical trial sites are often selected based on the location of investigators rather than patients.
- Knowledge, attitudes, and incentives of potential participants and their physicians hinder participation.
