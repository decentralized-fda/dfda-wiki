### E.3.2 Lengthy Timelines

- According to one study, the average length of time from the start of clinical testing to marketing is 90.3 months (7.5 years).
- Longer timelines increase costs and decrease revenues.
- Longer studies are needed to see if any safety issues arise when drugs are taken long-term to manage chronic diseases.
- The “one-off” nature of trial organization protracts trial initiation timeframes.
- The clinical trial business model has not kept pace with potential for efficiency gains through technological advances or centralized coordination.
