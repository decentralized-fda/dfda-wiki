## Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Sources
- **OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators (MSTI)**
- **UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)**
- **National budget documents and appropriations**

### Limitations
- **Incomplete data**: Many countries don't report detailed health R&D breakdowns
- **Definitional differences**: "Health research" varies by country
- **Timing**: Data availability ranges from 2022-2024
- **Coverage**: Some regional and local funding may be missed

### Notes
- Figures are converted to USD using approximate 2024 exchange rates
- "Health research" includes biomedical, clinical, public health, and health services research
- Excludes private sector R&D (pharmaceutical companies, medical device firms)
- Excludes university research not directly funded by government agencies

## Updates and Maintenance

This page should be updated annually to reflect new budget appropriations and spending data. Key sources to check:
- **U.S. Congressional appropriations** (typically October-December)
- **EU budget cycles** (7-year framework programs)
- **OECD MSTI database** (annual updates)
- **National budget announcements** (varies by country)
