# Public Opinion Survey: Reforming Medical Research

This survey is designed to measure public support for a global initiative to significantly upgrade medical research and treatment approval systems, making them faster, cheaper, and more effective. Your anonymous responses will help demonstrate public demand for reform to policymakers worldwide.

---

## Section 1: Priorities and Funding

**Q1: Budget Allocation**
If you had $100 in tax dollars to allocate, how would you distribute it between the following two areas?
- Military Defense: \_\_\_\_\_
- Medical Research: \_\_\_\_\_
  (Total must add up to $100)

**Q2: International Cooperation in Funding Research**
Imagine your country was considering joining a global treaty to redirect 1% of military spending towards accelerating medical research through a global treasury called the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md).

**(A)** If **all other major nations** also agreed to contribute a similar percentage of their military budgets, what percentage of your country's military budget would you support reallocating?
- 0%
- 1%
- 2-5%
- 6-10%
- More than 10%
- Unsure

**(B)** Now, imagine your country was considering this **unilaterally** (acting alone), and no other countries had agreed to contribute. What percentage of your country's military budget would you support reallocating in this case?
- 0%
- 1%
- 2-5%
- 6-10%
- More than 10%
- Unsure

## Section 2: Funding the Initiative for Reform

The following questions ask about your potential willingness to financially support this global effort. The total cost will be far greater than $5 million, but we are starting with an initial fundraising goal of **$5 million**. This pilot fund will be used to build public awareness and mobilize the required 3.5% of the population in our first target country, proving the model for global expansion.

**Q3: Investing in `$VICTORY` Bonds**
To fund this effort, the [DIH Treasury](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md) plans to issue **`$VICTORY` Bonds** for the war on disease. Citizens could buy these bonds to fund medical research and the advocacy effort. Bondholders would be repaid over time by nations that sign the 1% Treaty. Would you be interested in purchasing such a bond?
- Yes, definitely
- Yes, probably
- No, I am not interested in a bond, but I might donate.
- Unsure / Need more information

**Q4: Direct Donation**
Thinking of it as a traditional donation to the **$5 million advocacy fund**, how much would you be willing to contribute?
- $5
- $25
- $100
- $500
- Other (please specify)

**Q5: Donation with a Money-Back Guarantee (Assurance Contract)**
Now, imagine that donation came with a money-back guarantee. If the initiative does *not* reach its **$5 million funding goal**, your contribution would be fully refunded. Under this "all-or-nothing" condition, how much would you be willing to contribute?
- $5
- $25
- $100
- $500
- Other (please specify)

**Q6: Investment for a Return**
Finally, imagine your contribution to the **$5 million fund** was an *investment* that could provide a financial return. If the effort succeeds, investors would be repaid their principal plus a share of future funds. How much would you consider investing?
- $5
- $25
- $100
- $500
- Other (please specify)

## Section 3: Principles for Research Reform

The following questions are about the core principles of this initiative, which aims to accelerate medical progress by creating a decentralized, open-source platform to make clinical trials faster, cheaper, and accessible to all patients.

**Q7: Support for the Principles**
Based on these goals, to what extent do you support or oppose creating a new system based on these principles?
- Strongly Support
- Support
- Neutral
- Oppose
- Strongly Oppose

**Q7b: What is the primary reason for your answer? (Select one)**

- Agree
- Neutral
- Disagree
- Strongly Disagree


## Section 3: The People's Budget (Wishocracy by Program)

This section asks you to act as a policymaker. We will show you a series of randomly chosen pairs of government programs. For each pair, please allocate **$100** between them using the slider, according to your priorities. Your responses will help create a "People's Budget" to illustrate how public priorities may differ from current government spending.

**Instructions:**
For each pair presented, move the slider to distribute $100.
_Example: Program A: <-----X-----> Program B ($70 to A, $30 to B)_

**Program List for Pairwise Comparison:**
-   **dFDA (Decentralized FDA):** Funding for faster, cheaper clinical trials.
-   **DIH (Decentralized Institutes of Health):** A global treasury to fund medical research and patient access.
-   **Department of Defense:** Funding for the military.
-   **Department of Health & Human Services:** Funding for NIH, CDC, and public health programs.
-   **Department of Education:** Funding for public schools and universities.
-   **F-35 Fighter Jet Program:** A specific, high-cost military hardware project.
-   **Fossil Fuel Subsidies:** Government financial support for oil, gas, and coal industries.
-   **Enforcing Marijuana Prohibition:** Police and prison costs for non-violent marijuana offenses.
-   **Deportation of Non-Violent Immigrants:** Funding for a program of mass deportations.
-   **Enforcement for Violent Crime:** Funding for police, courts, and prisons to address violent crime. _Only ~45% of violent crimes are solved each year in the U.S._
-   **Enforcement for Property Crime:** Funding for police, courts, and prisons to address theft, burglary, arson, etc. _Only ~14% of property crimes are solved each year in the U.S._

## Section 4: The Future of Medical Research

**Q10: Trust in a New System**
The proposed platform would use AI to analyze data and transparently rank the effectiveness of treatments. Assuming strong security and privacy protections, how much would you trust a system like this compared to the current system?
- Trust it a lot more
- Trust it somewhat more
- Trust it about the same
- Trust it somewhat less
- Trust it a lot less

**Q11: Perceived Risk**
The current drug approval process is slow, and an estimated 21,000 to 120,000 people die each decade waiting for new treatments. A faster, more open system could save lives but might also carry new risks. Which do you consider the greater risk?
- The risk of letting people suffer and die from treatable diseases due to slow regulatory approval.
- The risk of approving a new treatment that might have unknown side effects.
- They are about equal.

**Q12: The Economic Cost of Delay**
Medical discoveries made today may not become available to patients for over 15 years, costing the global economy trillions in lost productivity and treatment expenses. How urgent of a problem do you believe this "time lag" is for your country's economy?
- Extremely Urgent
- Very Urgent
- Somewhat Urgent
- Not Urgent

**Q13: Perceived Healthcare Savings**
By making clinical trials faster and more efficient, experts believe a new system could significantly reduce the trillions spent on healthcare globally each year. How much impact do you believe this reform could have on national and global healthcare costs?
- A very large positive impact (significant savings)
- A moderate positive impact
- A small positive impact
- No real impact
- Unsure

**Q14: Personal Participation**
If you or a loved one had a serious condition, and a decentralized trial for a promising new treatment was available through a platform like the one described, how likely would you be to participate?
- Very Likely
- Somewhat Likely
- Unsure
- Somewhat Unlikely
- Very Unlikely

## Section 5: Crowdsourcing Global Priorities (Wishocracy)

The final question uses a method called **Randomized Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation**. This is designed to build a discretionary budget that accurately reflects the public's priorities for the problems we should solve as a global community.

**How it works:** You will be shown a series of random pairs of major global problems. For each pair, please use the slider to allocate $100 between the two problem areas based on which you believe is more important to solve. By aggregating thousands of these individual choices, we can construct a full "budget" that shows how people worldwide would prioritize spending to solve these key issues.

**Example Prompt:**

> **Pair 1 of 15**
>
> You are allocating $100 to solve two global problems:
>
> *   **Finding cures for diseases like Cancer & Alzheimer's**
> *   **Exploring space and advancing our understanding of the universe**
>
> Please slide to indicate your preferred allocation.
>
> **Curing Disease** `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50"> `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> **Space Exploration**

---

**(For implementation, a list of global problems would be randomly paired for each user. Potential problems to solve include):**
*   **Peace and Security:** Promoting international stability and preventing conflict.
*   **Medical Cures:** Finding cures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease.
*   **Education:** Improving K-12 schools and making college more affordable.
*   **Veterans' Care:** Providing healthcare, housing, and benefits for military veterans.
*   **Infrastructure:** Rebuilding roads, bridges, public transit, and the energy grid.
*   **Environmental Protection:** Cleaning our air and water and protecting natural habitats.
*   **Clean Energy:** Developing and deploying renewable energy sources to combat climate change.
*   **International Aid:** Providing humanitarian and disaster relief to other countries.
*   **Scientific Discovery:** Funding fundamental scientific research and space exploration.
*   **Public Safety:** Supporting law enforcement and improving the justice system.
*   **Affordable Housing:** Increasing the availability of safe and affordable housing.
*   **Food & Agriculture:** Supporting farmers and ensuring a safe, affordable food supply.
*   **Economic Opportunity:** Creating jobs and supporting small businesses.

## Section 5: Crowdsourced Budget Allocation (By Program)

Now, let's look at the same concept from a different angle. This section asks you to allocate funds between specific public programs or departments. This helps us understand public priorities when framed by how governments are currently structured. The following list uses U.S. agencies as examples, but the concept applies to similar public bodies in any country.

**How it works:** You will again be shown a series of random pairs. For each pair, please use the slider to allocate $100 between the two programs based on which you believe is more important to fund.

**Example Prompt:**

> **Pair 1 of 15**
>
> You are allocating $100 between two areas:
>
> *   **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**
> *   **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)**
>
> Please slide to indicate your preferred allocation.
>
> **NIH** `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50"> `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> **NASA**

---

**Potential Programs for Comparison:**

*   National Institutes of Health (NIH)
*   National Science Foundation (NSF)
*   Department of Defense
*   Department of Education
*   Department of Energy
*   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
*   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
*   Department of Transportation
*   Department of Homeland Security
*   Department of State (includes foreign aid)
*   Department of Veterans Affairs
*   Justice and Law Enforcement
*   Housing and Urban Development
*   Food and Agriculture
*   A direct cash payment to every citizen in your country

## Section 6: The "How": Government Programs vs. Direct Citizen Funding

The final question is about the best way to use public funds to solve problems. Please allocate $100 between the two approaches below.

*   **Fund Government Programs:** The government uses tax dollars to fund federal agencies and specific programs designed to solve national problems.
*   **Fund Citizens Directly:** The government distributes tax dollars equally to all citizens, who can then use the money to address their own needs, donate to charities they support, or fund solutions directly.

Please slide to indicate your preferred allocation for how to spend public money.

**Government Programs** `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50"> `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> **Direct to Citizens**
