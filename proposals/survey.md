# Survey: Reforming Medical Research & Funding

## Introduction

This survey gathers public opinion on two major proposals designed to address critical flaws in our medical research system. Currently, it takes an average of **17 years** for a new treatment to reach patients, and **95% of rare diseases have no approved therapy**. Your anonymous responses will help measure public demand for the following reforms.

1.  **The 1% Treaty:** A plan for all nations to redirect 1% of military spending to accelerate medical innovation.
2.  **The Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Initiatives:** Proposals to give patients the right to join clinical trials and to modernize health agencies, making new treatments safe, effective, and rapidly accessible.

### Part 1: The 1% Treaty

The "1% Treaty" proposes that all signatory nations redirect 1% of their annual military budget to a global fund. Proponents argue that accelerating medical progress is a critical component of national and global security. This fund would subsidize patient participation in decentralized clinical trials, aiming to dramatically accelerate the development of new cures. ([Read the full security rationale here.](./national-security-argument.md))

**1. Do you support or oppose your country signing the 1% Treaty?**
  - [ ] Support
  - [ ] Oppose
  - [ ] Unsure / Need more information

### Part 2: Core Funding Priorities

**2. Imagine you are given \$100 representing public funds. How would you allocate it between the following two areas?** (The total must add up to \$100).

- **Military / National Defense:** \$______
- **A Decentralized Institutes of Health (to fund efficient medical trials):** \$______

### Part 3: Upgrading Our Medical System

Real-world examples, like the UK's RECOVERY trial, have demonstrated that it is possible to run clinical trials for a fraction of the standard cost (roughly \$500 per patient vs. \$43,000). The following questions ask your opinion on specific upgrades to our own system, inspired by these proven successes.

This section asks for your opinion on specific upgrades to agencies like the FDA.

**3. Should agencies like the FDA be required to publicly rank the most effective treatments for diseases based on *all* available clinical and real-world evidence?**
  - [ ] Yes
  - [ ] No
  - [ ] Unsure

**4. Currently, it's estimated that up to 85% of patients are excluded from participating in clinical trials. Should all patients have the right to easily participate in decentralized, pragmatic clinical trials for promising treatments for their condition?**
  - [ ] Yes
  - [ ] No
  - [ ] Unsure

**5. Should public funds be used to subsidize a patient's participation in a trial, with the subsidy size based on the expected public value of the data their participation would generate?**
  - [ ] Yes
  - [ ] No
  - [ ] Unsure

### Part 4: Detailed Spending Priorities (Pairwise Comparison)

This section uses a method we call **"Wishocracy"** to understand priorities in more detail. You will be shown several pairs of public spending areas. For each pair, please allocate \$100 between them based on which you feel is more important.

**(Note: In the live survey, these pairs would be presented one at a time and randomized.)**

**Example Pair:**
-   **National Institutes of Health (NIH):** \$______
-   **Department of Defense:** \$______

**List of Areas for Comparison:**
-   Scientific & Medical Research
-   National Defense
-   Healthcare
-   Education
-   Infrastructure
-   Environmental Protection
-   Justice System & Public Safety
-   Social Security & Pensions
-   International Aid
