# Public Opinion Survey: Reforming Medical Research

This survey is designed to gather public opinion on modernizing the medical research system. The data will be used to inform legislators about public priorities regarding healthcare innovation, patient access to treatments, and federal funding.

## Section 1: Priorities and Funding

**Q1: Budget Allocation**
If you had $100 in tax dollars to allocate, how would you distribute it between the following two areas?
- Military Defense: \_\_\_\_\_
- Medical Research: \_\_\_\_\_
  (Total must add up to $100)

**Q2: International Cooperation in Funding Research**
Imagine the U.S. was considering redirecting a portion of its military budget to a global fund for medical research, the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md).

**(A)** If **all other major nations** also agreed to contribute a similar percentage of their military budgets, what percentage of the U.S. military budget would you support reallocating to this fund?
- 0%
- 1%
- 2-5%
- 6-10%
- More than 10%
- Unsure

**(B)** Now, imagine the U.S. was considering this **unilaterally** (acting alone), and no other countries had agreed to contribute. What percentage of the U.S. military budget would you support reallocating in this case?
- 0%
- 1%
- 2-5%
- 6-10%
- More than 10%
- Unsure

## Section 2: The Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act

The proposed [Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act](act.md) aims to accelerate medical progress by creating a decentralized, open-source platform to make clinical trials faster, cheaper, and accessible to all patients.

**Q3: Support for the Act**
Based on its goals, to what extent do you support or oppose the passage of the "Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act"?
- Strongly Support
- Support
- Neutral
- Oppose
- Strongly Oppose

**Q4: Patient Access to Trials**
Currently, up to 85% of patients are excluded from clinical trials. The Act would give all patients the right to participate in trials for their condition. How important is it to you that patient access to clinical trials is expanded?
- Very Important
- Somewhat Important
- Neutral
- Not Very Important
- Not at all Important

**Q5: Data and Transparency**
A key feature of the proposed system is making all trial data and research findings publicly available to accelerate innovation. How much do you agree or disagree with the principle that research funded by taxpayer dollars should be open-source?
- Strongly Agree
- Agree
- Neutral
- Disagree
- Strongly Disagree

## Section 3: The Future of Medical Research

**Q6: Trust in a New System**
The proposed platform would use AI to analyze data and transparently rank the effectiveness of treatments. Assuming strong security and privacy protections, how much would you trust a system like this compared to the current system?
- Trust it a lot more
- Trust it somewhat more
- Trust it about the same
- Trust it somewhat less
- Trust it a lot less

**Q7: Perceived Risk**
The current drug approval process is slow, and an estimated 21,000 to 120,000 people die each decade waiting for new treatments. A faster, more open system could save lives but might also carry new risks. Which do you consider the greater risk?
- The risk of letting people suffer and die from treatable diseases due to slow regulatory approval.
- The risk of approving a new treatment that might have unknown side effects.
- They are about equal.

**Q8: Personal Participation**
If you or a loved one had a serious condition, and a decentralized trial for a promising new treatment was available through a platform like the one described, how likely would you be to participate?
- Very Likely
- Somewhat Likely
- Unsure
- Somewhat Unlikely
- Very Unlikely

## Section 4: Crowdsourcing National Priorities (Wishocracy)

The final question uses a method called **Randomized Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation**. This is designed to build a federal discretionary budget that accurately reflects the public's priorities for the problems we should solve as a nation.

**How it works:** You will be shown a series of random pairs of major national problems. For each pair, please use the slider to allocate $100 between the two problem areas based on which you believe is more important to solve. By aggregating thousands of these individual choices, we can construct a full "budget" that shows how the American people would prioritize spending to solve these key issues.

**Example Prompt:**

> **Pair 1 of 15**
>
> You are allocating $100 to solve two national problems:
>
> *   **Finding cures for diseases like Cancer & Alzheimer's**
> *   **Exploring space and advancing our understanding of the universe**
>
> Please slide to indicate your preferred allocation.
>
> **Curing Disease** `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50"> `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> **Space Exploration**

---

**(For implementation, a list of national problems would be randomly paired for each user. Potential problems to solve include):**
*   **National Security:** Maintaining a strong military for national defense.
*   **Medical Cures:** Finding cures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease.
*   **Education:** Improving K-12 schools and making college more affordable.
*   **Veterans' Care:** Providing healthcare, housing, and benefits for military veterans.
*   **Infrastructure:** Rebuilding roads, bridges, public transit, and the energy grid.
*   **Environmental Protection:** Cleaning our air and water and protecting natural habitats.
*   **Clean Energy:** Developing and deploying renewable energy sources to combat climate change.
*   **International Aid:** Providing humanitarian and disaster relief to other countries.
*   **Scientific Discovery:** Funding fundamental scientific research and space exploration.
*   **Public Safety:** Supporting law enforcement and improving the justice system.
*   **Affordable Housing:** Increasing the availability of safe and affordable housing.
*   **Food & Agriculture:** Supporting farmers and ensuring a safe, affordable food supply.
*   **Economic Opportunity:** Creating jobs and supporting small businesses.

## Section 5: Crowdsourced Budget Allocation (By Program)

Now, let's look at the same concept from a different angle. This section asks you to allocate funds between specific federal programs or departments. This helps us understand public priorities when framed by how the government is currently structured.

**How it works:** You will again be shown a series of random pairs. For each pair, please use the slider to allocate $100 between the two programs based on which you believe is more important to fund.

**Example Prompt:**

> **Pair 1 of 15**
>
> You are allocating $100 between two areas:
>
> *   **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**
> *   **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)**
>
> Please slide to indicate your preferred allocation.
>
> **NIH** `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50"> `$`<input type="text" value="50" size="3"> **NASA**

---

**(For implementation, a list of discretionary budget items would be randomly paired for each user. Potential categories include):**
*   Military and Defense
*   Medical Research (e.g., NIH, CDC)
*   Education
*   Veterans' Benefits
*   Infrastructure (Transportation, Roads, Bridges)
*   Environmental Protection & Clean Energy
*   International Affairs and Foreign Aid
*   Science and Technology (e.g., NASA, NSF)
*   Justice and Law Enforcement
*   Housing and Urban Development
*   Food and Agriculture
