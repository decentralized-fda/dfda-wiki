# Objective

Disease eradication.

# How it works

Upgrade all global health agencies to allow any patient to:
1. Quantify the safety and effectiveness of all treatments based on the entiree


# We Can Eradicate Disease

🚀 by giving all patients the right to effortlessly participate in global decentralized clinical research 💊

## Problems We Can Solve

To have any hope of eradicating disease, we first need to solve the following problems:

👥

$41k

cost per participant in traditional clinical trials

💸

$1.6 Billion

cost to develop a new treatment falls on patients

☠️

120,000 Deaths/Decade

due to regulatory delays

🚫

85%

of patients are unable to participate in clinical trials

💊

95%

of diseases have NO FDA-approved treatments

🤒

17 years

of suffering until a new treatment reaches patients

⚛️

166 billion

potential treatments have not been tested

🌍

2 Billion

people are suffering from uncured diseases

🧫

44 years

since we last cured a disease

## The World We Can Create 🌍

If we gave every patient the right to effortlessly participate in decentralized clinical trials, we could achieve:

🚀

20X

the rate of treatment discovery

📉

95%

lower costs of clinical trials and treatments

🤑

📈

🌍

100%

of patients can participate in trials

⚡

2 Years

instead of 17 years to get new treatments to patients

## How it Works: Upgrade FDA.gov 🚀

Use a small fraction of the FDA's $7 billion annual budget to upgrade FDA.gov to allow ANY patient ANYWHERE in the world to:

### 1\. Enter Your Condition

Cost analysis based on data from: ["Examination of Clinical Trial Costs and Barriers for Drug Development"](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE).

### 💡 Key Benefits

- Automated processes reduce manual labor costs
- AI-driven analysis improves efficiency and accuracy
- Decentralized approach eliminates site-related expenses
- Blockchain technology ensures data integrity

Our cost reduction estimates are derived from the ASPE study's analysis of clinical trial costs across different therapeutic areas and phases, incorporating potential savings from electronic data capture, simplified protocols, and decentralized trial approaches.

## Problems a Decentralized FDA Could Solve

💰

### Clinical Research is Expensive

It costs $1.6 billion to bring a drug to market (including failed attempts) and trials currently cost over $36k per participant.

⌛

### Clinical Research is Slow

It takes an average of 17 years for new treatments to reach patients.

⏱

### Deaths Due to US Regulatory Drug Lag

Delays in new interventions cost anywhere from 21,000 to 120,000 US lives per decade.

🚧

### 90% of Willing Patients Do Not Participate in Clinical Trials

A significant gap exists between the number of patients willing to participate in clinical trials and those who actually do. Studies indicate that while 68% of patients express interest in participating, only 9% report being invited to a clinical trial.

🤪

### Lack of Logical Reasoning Based on Quantitative Cost-Benefit Analysis in FDA Decisions

FDA regulatory decisions often lack logical reasoning based on quantitative cost-benefit analysis.

🙈

### Negative Results are Never Published

We waste billions of dollars repeating failed drug trials because companies only publish the positive results.

📊

### No Treatment Effectiveness Rankings

Shockingly, the existing system does not give us a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments for a given condition.

🥫

### No Data on Unpatentable Treatments

We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over 7,000 different synthetic or natural chemicals you consume every day.

🗓

### No Long-Term Outcome Data

Current trials often only last a few months, so we have no idea what the long-term positive or negative effects of a drug are!

🤒

### People With Rare Disease are Severely Punished

It's impossible to recover a billion dollars of drug development from a small number of patients.

🔮

### Pre-Determining Clinical Endpoints Requires Psychic Powers

Drug Developers to Have Psychic Powers Needed to Pre-Determine Very Specific Clinical Endpoints Before Collecting Data

🥸

### Trials Often Aren't Representative of Real Patients

Clinical trials often exclude as much as 85% of patients so they don't tell us if the drug will work for the majority of patients.

❓

### We Know Next to Nothing

There are thousands of diseases and trillions of compounds with drug-like properties, but we've only studied 0.000000002% of potential treatments so far.
