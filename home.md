# Our Modest Proposal

80X medical progress by upgrading fda.gov and giving all patients the right to effortlessly participate in global decentralized clinical trials 💊

## Problems We Can Solve

👥 [$41k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001) cost per participant in traditional clinical trials

💸 [$1.6 Billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311) cost to develop a new treatment falls on patients

☠️ [120,000 Deaths/Decade](ttps://www.fdareview.org/features/references/#gieringer85) due to regulatory delays

🚫 [85% of patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985) are unable to participate in clinical trials

💊 [95% of diseases](ttps://ncats.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NCATS_RareDiseasesFactSheet.pdf) have **NO** FDA-approved treatments

🤒 [17 years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/) of suffering until a new treatment reaches patients

⚛️ [166 billion](https://www.nature.com/articles/549445a) potential treatments have not been tested

🌍 [2 Billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people are suffering from uncured diseases

🧫 [44 years](https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox) since we last cured a disease

🙈 **Negative Results are Never Published** so we waste billions of dollars repeating failed drug trials.

📊 **No Treatment Effectiveness Rankings** - The existing system does not give us a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments for a given condition.

🥫 **No Data on Unpatentable Substances** - We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over 7,000 different synthetic or natural chemicals you consume every day.

🗓 **No Long-Term Outcome Data** - Current trials often only last a few months, so we have no idea what the long-term positive or negative effects of a drug are!

🤒 **People With Rare Disease are Severely Punished** - It's impossible to recover a billion dollars of drug development from a small number of patients.

🔮 **Pre-Determining Clinical Endpoints Requires Psychic Powers** - Drug Developers to Have Psychic Powers Needed to Pre-Determine Very Specific Clinical Endpoints Before Collecting Data

🥸 **Trials Often Aren't Representative of Real Patients** - Clinical trials often exclude as much as 85% of patients so they don't tell us if the drug will work for the majority of patients.

## How To Fix It: Upgrade FDA.gov 🚀

With a small fraction of the FDA's $7 billion annual budget to upgrade FDA.gov, we can allow ANY patient ANYWHERE in the world to:

### 1. Enter Your Condition

Simply input the condition that's making you miserable.

### 2. View Ranked Treatments

See a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments based on the entire universe of clinical and real-world data.

### 3. Join Clinical Trials from Home

Instantly enroll in decentralized trials for promising treatments that interest you.

### 4. Get Treatment Delivered

Get treatments delivered to your pharmacy or physician and schedule necessary lab tests automatically.

### 5. Effortlessly Report Outcomes

Report treatment effects easily through your preferred apps, EHR systems, or automated calls.

### 6. Continuously Improve Rankings

Your data helps improve treatment rankings and benefits future patients globally.
