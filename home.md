# Overview

The Wikipedia model demonstrates the tremendous power of crowdsourcing and open collaboration. Despite Microsoft spending billions of dollars hiring thousands of expert PhDs to create Encarta, Wikipedia garnered over 50 times more content in just a few years - all from volunteers. Moreover, studies have shown Wikipedia's accuracy on scientific topics rivals leading encyclopedias. 

The Decentralized FDA aims to produce a 50X acceleration in clinical discovery by replicating this model for clinical research. By crowdsourcing real-world data and observations from patients, clinicians, and researchers, the Decentralized FDA could enable orders of magnitude more insights and discovery than the current closed research system. 

Rather than a few expensive clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies, the Decentralized FDA would facilitate a massive decentralized clinical trial encompassing millions of patients. This "Wikipedization" of evidence-based research can unlock lifesaving knowledge at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional methods. Just as Wikipedia democratized access to knowledge, the Decentralized FDA can democratize health research and empower people with actionable data to improve lives.

# Problems We're Trying To Solve Here

The existing regulatory framework for drug approval presents several challenges, hindering the efficiency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical research and public health advancements:

- **Prolonged Time and High Costs:** It takes over a decade and \$2.6 billion on average to bring a drug to market, with Phase III clinical trials costing around \$41k per subject.
- **Limited Knowledge on Unpatentable Molecules:** There is a significant lack of data on the long-term effects of the majority of synthetic or natural compounds, as there is insufficient incentive to research non-patentable molecules.
- **Inadequate Exploration of Off-Patent Treatments:** There is a lack of financial incentive to approve drugs for additional conditions after their patent expires, leaving potential treatments for rare diseases unexplored.
- **Absence of Long-Term Outcome Data:** Due to financial constraints, long-term effects of drugs are often unknown.
- **Publication Bias:** Negative results are frequently unreported, leading to redundant research efforts and wasted resources.
- **Exclusion of Diverse Patient Populations:** Clinical trials often exclude a vast majority of the patient population, limiting the generalizability of findings.
- **Vast Amount of Unresearched Combinations:** The immense number of possible molecule-disease combinations leaves 99.9999998% of potential knowledge undiscovered.
- **Bias Towards Rejecting Effective Treatments:** Cognitive biases and personal risk aversion among regulators result in a tendency to reject potentially life-saving treatments.

To overcome these perverse incentives and biases, implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) regulatory body is proposed. This would distribute responsibility among a large group of experts, mitigating individual risk and bias, and fostering a more balanced, efficient, and innovative drug approval process. 👉 [Learn More](/problems-in-clinical-research)

# Problem: You and Everyone You Love Will Suffer and Die

Over [2 billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people are suffering and [150,000](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-many-people-die-each-day-covid-19-coronavirus/) people die every single day from preventable diseases. 
For perspective, this is equivalent to:

* [**FIFTY-ONE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_September\_11\_attacks) September 11th attacks every day
* [**NINE**](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/6-million-where-is-the-figure-from-1.10570907) Holocausts every year

# 💡 Solution: A Collaborative Framework for Personalized, Precision Health

The solution is to use the oceans of real-world evidence to accelerate the discovery of new cures and reveal hidden causes of disease.

The human body can be viewed as a black box with inputs (like diet, treatments, etc.) and outputs (like symptom severity). We're creating a mathematical model of human biology to determine the input factors and values that produce optimal health outcomes.


![machine-learning-health-optimization.png](/machine-learning-health-optimization.png)

## The Potential of the Oceans of Real-World Evidence

* **Discovering Hidden Causes of Illness** - Data mining and analysis to identify hidden factors in our daily life that are making us sicker
* **Preventative medicine** - Predictive analytics and data analysis of genetic, lifestyle, and social circumstances to prevent disease
* **Precision medicine** - Leveraging aggregate data to determine the precise treatments and dosages for your unique biology
* **Accelerated Treatment Discovery** - Data-driven medical and pharmacological research to discover new treatments and medicines
* **Reduction of adverse medication events** - Harnessing big data to spot medication errors and flag potential adverse reactions
* **Cost reduction** - Driving better patient outcomes for long-term savings through prevention and avoidance of expensive and ineffective treatments
* **Population health** - Identify health strategies based on demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic trends

# Why Clinical Research Has Failed

It takes over [10 years and 2.6 billion dollars](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Innovation-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry%3A-New-of-DiMasiGrabowski/3275f31c072ac11c6ca7a5260bd535720f07df41) to bring a drug to market (including failed attempts). 
It costs [$41k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001) per subject in Phase III clinical trials.

The high costs lead to:

**1. No Data on Unpatentable Molecules**

We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over [7,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8757191/Are-additives-food-making-ill.html) different synthetic or natural compounds. This is because there's only sufficient incentive to research patentable molecules.

![](/assets/chemicals-in-our-diet.png)

**2. Lack of Incentive to Discover Every Application of Off-Patent Treatments**

Most of the known diseases (approximately 95%) are classified as rare diseases. Currently, a pharmaceutical company must predict particular conditions to treat before running a clinical trial. Suppose a drug is effective for other diseases after the patent expires. In that case, there isn't a financial incentive to get it approved for the different conditions.

**3. No Long-Term Outcome Data**

It's not financially feasible to collect a participant's data for years or decades. Thus, we don't know if the long-term effects of a drug are worse than the initial benefits.

**4. Negative Results Aren't Published**

Pharmaceutical companies tend to only report "positive" results. That leads to other companies wasting money repeating research on the same dead ends.

**5. Trials Exclude a Vast Majority of The Population**

One investigation found that only [14.5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985) of patients with major depressive disorder fulfilled eligibility requirements for enrollment in an antidepressant trial. Furthermore, most patient sample sizes are very small and sometimes include only 20 people.

**6. We Only Know 0.000000002% of What is Left to be Researched**

The more research studies we read, the more we realize we don't know. Nearly every study ends with the phrase "more research is needed".

If you multiply the [166 billion](https://www.nature.com/articles/549445a) molecules with drug-like properties by the [10,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/17/are-there-really-10000-diseases-and-500-cures/) known diseases, that's 1,162,000,000,000,000 combinations. So far, we've studied [21,000 compounds](https://www.centerwatch.com/articles/12702-new-mit-study-puts-clinical-research-success-rate-at-14-percent). That means we only know 0.000000002% of the effects left to be discovered.

![](/assets/studied-molecules-chart-no-background.png)

# Why Digital Health Innovation Has Failed

## Duplication of Effort

Despite this massive growth in health data and innovation, we've seen increased costs and disease burden and decreased life expectancy.

![](/assets/digital-health-has-failed-large.png)

The reason is awful **incentives**. There are more than [350,000](https://www.emarketer.com/content/over-350k-digital-health-apps-flooding-market-here-s-how-apps-stand) health apps. 
Each costs an average of [\$425,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) to develop. 
Most have significant overlap in functionality, representing a cost of [$157,500,000,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) on duplication of effort.

![](/assets/collaboration-is-punished.PNG)

Isolated streams of health data can only tell us about the past. For example, dashboards filled with descriptive statistics such as our daily steps or sleep.

![](/assets/thousands-of-dashboards.PNG)

If this data and innovation efforts were combined, this could increase the rate of progress by 350,000 times.

![](/assets/vertical-innovation.PNG)

The obstacle has been the free-rider problem. Software developers that open source their code give their closed-source competitors an unfair advantage, increasing their likelihood of bankruptcy.

**How to Overcome the Free-Rider Problem**

1. **Government Grants** - Currently, governments spend billions funding closed-source propriety health software. The Public Money, Public Code initiative requires governments to recognize software as a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_good\_\(economics\)) that is open source. This would lead to a massive influx in grant funding for open-source digital health projects.
2. **Open-Source Royalty Compensation** - By encoding contributions to the project with NFTs, we can provide ongoing royalty payments to open-source contributors.
3. **Licensing** - The project core framework will be open-source for any non-commercial purpose. However, we will utilize a [Fair-code](https://faircode.io) or [Fair Source](https://fair.io/?a) licensing model to generate revenue when used by for-profit entities. Licensing fees will be negotiated such that a fraction of the profits generated by the licensee's project use.
4. **Managed Software-as-a-Service** - Digital health companies can save months of development time and tens of thousands of dollars using our platform instead of reinventing the wheel. A usage-based subscription platform for health application developers would start at $0.50/end-user per month.
5. **For-Profit Plugins** - WordPress, the most widely used web framework globally, is open-source. Businesses earn revenue by creating for-profit plugins. They contribute to improvements of the open-source core WordPress platform because these improvements benefit their business directly.

# 🏛 Organization

CureDAO is a laboratory consisting of many experiments.

It's a global laboratory where the 7 billion human "natural experiments" are conducted, revealing the effects of various factors on human health and happiness.

It's an experiment to determine if a new model for clinical research using real-world data can more effectively reduce the global burden of chronic illness.

It's an experiment to see if a new economic model called Collaborationism can reward the creation of open-source "public goods" and overcome the failures of Capitalism and Communism.

It's an experiment to determine if a direct democracy can produce better results than traditional hierarchical command and control organizations.

Given the unprecedented nature of such a project, each working group will constantly be experimenting with new ways to execute this mission. We recognize the importance of using real-world evidence to improve human health. Execution within the working groups should take the same data-driven approach to manage their area of the overall mission.

Accordingly, the organization is composed of three primary components.

1. Citizen Scientists - CureDAO is an open and permissionless organization. Anyone has the right to earn their Citizenship through the contribution of labor or resources. In exchange, the Citizen Scientist will receive CureDAO tokens granting full governance rights over the actions of DAO Lab Staff
2. DAO Laboratories - Internal working groups that carry out the Citizen Scientists' wishes
3. External Service Providers - Individuals or entities outside the DAO deemed necessary to carry out the Citizen Scientists' wishes.
