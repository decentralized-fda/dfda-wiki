# ðŸ’¡ The Decentralized FDA Wiki

This repository contains the source for the dFDA Wiki, an initiative aiming to achieve an 80X acceleration in medical progress by upgrading fda.gov and giving all patients the right to effortlessly participate in global automated decentralized clinical trials.

## The Problem: A Broken System

The current medical research system is slow, expensive, and excludes most patients. Here are some key issues we aim to solve:

-   **High Costs**: Clinical trials cost around **\$43,000 per participant**, and developing a new treatment can cost over **\$2.2 Billion**.
-   **Slow Progress**: It takes an average of **17 years** for a new discovery to reach patients.
-   **Patient Exclusion**: **85% of patients** are excluded from clinical trials.
-   **Lack of Cures**: **95% of rare diseases** have no FDA-approved treatments.
-   **Publication Bias**: Negative results are often never published, leading to wasted resources.

## The Solution: A Decentralized, Automated Platform

We propose upgrading FDA.gov to create a platform that allows any patient, anywhere, to participate in clinical research. The core workflow is simple:

1.  **Enter Your Condition**: Patients start by entering their health condition.
2.  **View Ranked Treatments**: Access a ranked list of treatments based on global real-world data.
3.  **Join Trials from Home**: Instantly enroll in decentralized clinical trials.
4.  **Get Treatment Delivered**: Have treatments delivered to their local pharmacy or physician.
5.  **Effortlessly Report Outcomes**: Report outcomes via apps, EHRs, or automated calls.
6.  **Continuously Improve Rankings**: Patient data continuously improves treatment rankings for everyone.
