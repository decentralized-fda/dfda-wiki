# Reference Check Process and Form Template

This document outlines the process and provides templates for conducting reference checks. This should be one of the final steps in the hiring process, used only for candidates you are seriously considering for an offer.

## The Process

1.  **Request References from the Candidate:** Once a candidate has successfully passed the interview stages, inform them that you would like to proceed with reference checks. Ask them for the names and contact information of 2-3 professional references.
2.  **Send the Digital Form:** Email the reference form (see template below) to each reference. Using a form ensures you get structured, comparable data and is respectful of the reference's time.
3.  **Review the Submissions:** Analyze the submitted forms for positive signals and any potential red flags. Look for consistency across references.
4.  **(Optional) Follow-Up Call:** If the written feedback is excellent and you want to finalize your decision, you can offer the reference a brief, optional 15-minute follow-up call to ask any clarifying questions. This is typically only necessary for the final, chosen candidate.
