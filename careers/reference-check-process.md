# Reference Check Process: Founding AI Architect

This document outlines the process and templates for conducting reference checks for high-potential candidates for the **Founding AI Architect** role. This is a critical final step before extending an offer.

## The Process

1.  **Request References from the Candidate:** Once a candidate has successfully passed the architectural deep-dive session, ask them for 2-3 professional references who can speak to their technical and leadership abilities.
2.  **Send the Digital Form:** Email the form below to each reference. The questions are designed to gather structured data on their capacity to lead a technical offensive.
3.  **Review the Submissions:** Analyze submissions for strong positive signals on technical mastery, autonomy, and strategic thinking.
4.  **(Optional) Follow-Up Call:** For the final candidate, a brief follow-up call with their primary reference is recommended to confirm enthusiasm and clarify any points.
