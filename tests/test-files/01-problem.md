# Problem: You and Everyone You Love Will Suffer and Die

There are over [2 billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people suffering from chronic diseases.

Additionally, [150,000](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-many-people-die-each-day-covid-19-coronavirus/) people die every single day by possibly preventable degenerative diseases. For perspective, this is equivalent to:

* [**FIFTY-ONE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks) September 11th attacks every day
* [**NINE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks) Holocausts every year
