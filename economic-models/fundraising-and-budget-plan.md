# Fundraising & Budget Plan: The Activation Energy

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the total capital required to successfully implement the 1% Treaty and establish the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH). The figures presented here are the basis for our **$1.2B - $2.5B total fundraising goal**.

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Activation Energy"

The capital raised is not for ongoing operations; it is a one-time "activation energy" required to overcome the political inertia of the current system. This investment is designed to unlock a perpetual, multi-generational funding stream of **$27+ billion annually** for global health.

The budget is structured around a 36-month timeline and is divided into four primary operational categories.

## 2. Total Fundraising Requirement: $1.2B - $2.5B

The range reflects the variable nature of political campaigns and the potential to scale our efforts. A smaller, more targeted raise of $1.2B is considered the minimum viable amount, while a $2.5B raise would allow for a massively parallel, global campaign with a significantly higher probability of success.

### Multi-Phase Fundraising Strategy
The raise will be conducted in tranches, with each tranche tied to the achievement of specific, verifiable milestones.

1.  **Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)**
    *   **Goal:** To fund the development of the global referendum platform, establish the legal frameworks in pilot countries, and run the first electoral cycle interventions.
    *   **Milestone to Unlock Phase 2:** Secure 50 million verified referendum participants and/or secure a pro-treaty legislative majority in a pilot G20 nation.

2.  **Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)**
    *   **Goal:** To expand political operations to all G7 nations and achieve the 3.5% global participation threshold (280 million people).
    *   **Milestone to Unlock Phase 3:** Achieve the 3.5% threshold and/or secure the first national treaty commitment from a G7 nation.

3.  **Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)**
    *   **Goal:** To ensure treaty ratification in all major powers (US, EU, China) and fully capitalize the DIH treasury for its first year of operation.
    *   **Milestone:** Full operational deployment and the first $1B disbursement.

## 3. Detailed Budget Breakdown

The following table provides a line-item breakdown of the total estimated costs. A detailed justification for each category follows.

### Budget Justification & "Pay for Success" Implementation

The budget is designed to support a **hybrid strategy**, combining a grassroots, citizen-led referendum with a sophisticated, top-down plan to co-opt the existing military-industrial complex (MIC). This dual approach allows us to build undeniable public support while simultaneously removing our most powerful opposition. See our full analysis at [Co-Opting Defense Contractors](../strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.md).

#### 1. Independent Expenditures (Grassroots Campaign)
*   **Justification:** This budget funds the public-facing, citizen-led campaign. It is our primary tool for demonstrating overwhelming public will, which creates the political cover necessary for leaders to support the treaty. It includes advertising, polling, and get-out-the-vote operations for the global referendum.
*   **Pay-for-Success Model:** This will be structured with **prizes and bounties** and **performance-based contracts** for campaign and media firms.

#### 2. Strategic Incentive Alignment (Co-Opting the MIC)
*   **Justification:** This is the budget for our co-opting strategy. It is cheaper and more effective to "buy" the support of the existing lobbying infrastructure than to fight it. This capital will be used to structure superior investment opportunities (e.g., via `$VICTORY` Bonds) and performance-based grants for defense contractors, their investors, and their lobbyists, contingent on their support for the treaty.
*   **Pay-for-Success Model:** The entire category is inherently pay-for-success. Payouts are structured as targeted financial incentives that are only realized upon treaty ratification.

#### 3. Platform & Tech Development
*   **Justification:** This covers the engineering and infrastructure costs for the global voting and treasury platform.
*   **Pay-for-Success Model:** We will utilize **holdback and bonus structures** for development partners, with payouts contingent on the platform achieving specific performance milestones.

#### 4. Legal & Treaty Framework
*   **Justification:** This requires retaining elite law and lobbying firms to navigate the complexities of international law. A portion of this budget is also allocated to providing the legal architecture for the strategic incentive contracts.
*   **Pay-for-Success Model:** Engagements will be structured on a **contingency fee model**, with massive success fees paid upon treaty ratification.

#### 5. Referendum Payouts
*   **Justification:** The direct cost of incentivizing global participation to reach the 280 million (3.5%) target.
*   **Pay-for-Success Model:** This is inherently a "pay for success" model.

#### 6. Operations & Contingency
*   **Justification:** This covers the core operational staff and provides a necessary contingency fund for this highly complex global campaign.
*   **Pay-for-Success Model:** These are fixed costs that are difficult to tie directly to success metrics.
