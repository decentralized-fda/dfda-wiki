# The Investment Thesis: Making Cures More Profitable Than Killing

## 1. Executive Summary

The global economy is grotesquely misaligned, allocating **\$2.72 trillion** annually to military spending while just **\$67.5 billion** is directed toward medical research—a 40:1 disparity. This has created a market where investing in destruction is perceived as more profitable and stable than investing in curing diseases. This document provides the quantitative thesis for a strategic, one-time investment of **\$1.2–\$2.5 billion** to permanently flip this incentive structure.

The goal is to redirect a **\$27+ billion annual revenue stream** from military budgets to a democratically controlled health treasury. The investment vehicle, **\$VICTORY Bonds**, is designed to offer a risk-adjusted expected value superior to holding shares in top military contractors like Lockheed Martin (\$LMT) or Raytheon (\$RTX). We will use dynamic risk modeling, including Metaculus-style prediction markets, to transparently price risk and adjust returns, ensuring market-beating performance for investors who finance this historic reallocation of global capital.

## 2. The Market Failure: Profitability of Killing vs. Curing

A rational investor allocates capital where returns are highest. Over the last five years, major military contractors have delivered average annual returns of **[~8%](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2025/MilitaryContractors)**, while leading healthcare companies have yielded returns of **[~12%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2023/12/28/healthcare-stocks-poised-for-a-rebound-in-2024/)**. Despite healthcare's superior returns, the perceived stability and scale of military contracts creates a market that overwhelmingly incentivizes investment in militarism. Our thesis is not to compete within this broken system, but to execute a hostile takeover of its revenue stream.

| Metric                        | **Military Contractors (The "Killing" Market)**                                | **Medical Research & Healthcare (The "Curing" Market)**                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Annual Market Size**        | **\$2.72 Trillion** (Global Military Spending)                                 | **\$67.5 Billion** (Gov't Medical Research) + **\$4.3 Trillion** (US Healthcare Spending)                       |
| **Revenue Certainty**         | Extremely high. Top 5 contractors received **[\$771 billion](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2025/MilitaryContractors)** from the DoD (2020-24). | Variable. J&J 2023 revenue was **[\$94.9B](https://www.jnj.com/investor-relations/financial-information)**.                       |
| **Profitability**             | High and stable. Lockheed Martin earned **[\$70.8B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_100_Contractors_of_the_U.S._federal_government)** in 2023. | High but variable. J&J's 2023 profit margin was **[~22%](https://www.jnj.com/investor-relations/financial-information)**. |
| **Accountability & Waste**    | Extremely low (e.g., The Pentagon cannot account for **\$2.5 trillion**)       | High (Strict regulatory oversight, clinical trial failures)              |
| **Investor Certainty**        | High (Perceived as stable, government-backed)                                  | Medium (High R&D failure rates, long timelines)                       |

**Conclusion:** The perception of stability, driven by massive and guaranteed government contracts, funnels capital to military contractors despite superior returns often being available in healthcare.

## 3. Benchmarking Against Elite Investment Vehicles

While public military stocks offer stable `~8-12%` annual returns, the relevant benchmarks for our target investors are the top-performing private equity and hedge funds, which generate significantly higher returns.

| Investment Vehicle                       | Type                | Notable Returns                               | Source                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spectrum VIII-A Program**              | Private Equity      | **98.91% Net IRR** (2017 Vintage)               | [Alternatives Investor](https://alternativesinvestor.com/top-performing-private-equity-funds-2016-2019) |
| **Francisco Partners Agility, L.P.**     | Private Equity      | **92.59% Net IRR** (2016 Vintage)               | [Alternatives Investor](https://alternativesinvestor.com/top-performing-private-equity-funds-2016-2019) |
| **Renaissance Technologies (Medallion)** | Hedge Fund          | **~39% Net Annualized** (1988–2021)             | [Traders' Log](https://www.traderslog.com/top-hedge-funds)                                           |
| **Northrop Grumman (\$NOC)**             | Military Contractor | **~12% Annualized** (10-Year)                 | Market Data                                                                                         |
| **Lockheed Martin (\$LMT)**              | Military Contractor | **~10% Annualized** (10-Year)                 | Market Data                                                                                         |

Our goal is not to compete with the modest returns of public stocks, but to outperform the absolute best performers in the alternative investment space. **The Renaissance Medallion Fund's ~39% net annualized return is our specific target to beat.**

## 4. The Hidden Profitability: Private Equity and Cost-Plus Contracts

The ~8% average annual return for public military stocks is a misleading benchmark for sophisticated investors. The true profitability of the military-industrial complex is significantly higher and concentrated in two areas hidden from public markets:

1.  **Private Equity Returns:** Top-tier private equity firms (e.g., The Carlyle Group, Blackstone) specializing in aerospace and military acquisitions do not target 8% returns; they target **Internal Rates of Return (IRRs) of 20-30% or higher**. They achieve this by using leverage, restructuring, and wielding political influence to secure more lucrative contracts before selling the companies for a large profit. This is the real benchmark for high-finance investors.
2.  **"Cost-Plus" Contract Structures:** Many large-scale development contracts are "cost-plus," meaning the government pays all of a contractor's costs plus a guaranteed profit margin. This risk-free structure, which incentivizes higher spending to increase absolute profits, is the financial engine that guarantees returns for private investors and insulates the industry from normal market risks.

Our investment thesis is not merely to beat a public market ETF, but to offer a risk-adjusted return that is competitive with the most profitable private investment vehicles in the military sector.

## 5. Top 5 Military-Industrial Complex Investments

To understand the competitive benchmark, it's essential to know the key players whose profitability we aim to exceed. These companies are deeply involved in advanced weapons systems, including nuclear and autonomous technologies.

1.  **Lockheed Martin (\$LMT):** The largest military contractor. Produces the F-35 fighter jet and is a primary developer of hypersonic and autonomous weapons systems. Also manufactures the Trident II D5 nuclear missile.
2.  **RTX (Raytheon) (\$RTX):** A leader in missile systems, electronic warfare, and advanced sensors. Heavily invested in AI-driven autonomous systems and provides critical command and control for nuclear forces.
3.  **Northrop Grumman (\$NOC):** Builds the new B-21 Raider nuclear-capable stealth bomber and the Sentinel ICBM system. A dominant player in autonomous systems, including the Global Hawk and Triton drones.
4.  **General Dynamics (\$GD):** The primary builder of the Columbia-class nuclear submarine, the cornerstone of the U.S. nuclear triad. Also produces armored vehicles like the Abrams tank.
5.  **Palantir Technologies (\$PLTR):** Not a traditional hardware manufacturer, but a critical software and AI company. Its platforms are used by the DoD for intelligence analysis, targeting, and predictive battlefield management, forming the software backbone for autonomous warfare.

## 6. The "Flip" Model: Investment & Returns

We require **\$1.2–\$2.5 billion** in total capital to execute the plan. This is the "activation energy" needed to capture the \$27B annual revenue stream.

**Use of Funds:**
- **Global Referendum Platform (\$56M):** To generate a verifiable political mandate from 3.5% of the global population (280M people).
- **Independent Expenditures (\$800M–\$1.5B):** To legally support politicians who align with the referendum and fund challengers against those who do not. This directly outbids the military lobby's ~$15M spend to defend this revenue slice.
- **Platform & Legal (\$350M–\$600M):** To build the DIH treasury infrastructure and ensure multi-jurisdictional legal compliance.

**Projected Returns:**
- **Annual Inflows:** **\$27+ billion** (1% of \$2.72T military spending).
- **Breakeven Timeline:** 18–36 months after the first major treaty is ratified.
- **Partial Success Scenario:** Even if only 5 major allied countries participate, the annual inflow is **\$8.5 billion**, representing a **3.4X return** on a \$2.5B investment in year one alone.

## 7. Dynamic Risk Modeling & The Metaculus Framework

A primary objection from sophisticated investors is the difficulty of quantifying political risk. The 70% success probability cited on the landing page is a static estimate. To solve this, we will implement a dynamic, transparent risk modeling system.

**Mechanism: A Public Prediction Market (Metaculus Model)**
1.  **Create a Prediction Market:** We will establish a public prediction market (or use an existing one like Metaculus or Polymarket) with questions tied to key milestones.
2.  **Key Questions:**
    - "Will the 1% Treaty be ratified by the US & EU before Q4 2028?"
    - "What will be the total redirected annual funding for the DIH Treasury by January 1, 2030?"
    - "Will the global referendum reach 100 million verified signatures by Q2 2026?"
3.  **Use Data to Price Risk:** The real-time probabilities from this market will be used as a public, transparent measure of risk. This data will directly influence the returns offered on different tranches of \$VICTORY Bonds.

**Example Application:**
- If the market probability of hitting the \$27B target is 60%, the yield on a junior tranche of bonds might be adjusted upwards to compensate for the 40% risk of failure.
- If the probability moves to 80% after a key country signals support, the yield on new bonds could be lowered, reflecting the de-risked nature of the investment.

This turns unquantifiable political risk into a transparent, tradable metric, allowing investors to price their capital allocation accurately.

## 8. Competitive Benchmark: \$VICTORY Bonds vs. The Medallion Fund

The ultimate test for a sophisticated investor is whether this opportunity provides a better risk-adjusted return than the most legendary quantitative hedge fund in history.

**The Benchmark:**
- Let's compare the expected value of a **\$10 million** investment in \$VICTORY Bonds versus an equivalent (hypothetical) investment in Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund.
- We will use the Medallion Fund's famed **39% net annualized return** as our benchmark.

**Renaissance Medallion Fund (Hypothetical Investment):**
- **Investment:** \$10M
- **Expected Annual Return:** \$3.9M (39%)
- **Risk:** Extremely low (historically)
- **Expected Value (Year 1):** ~\$13.9 million

**\$VICTORY Bond Investment (Early, High-Risk Tranche):**
- **Investment:** \$10M
- **Base Return + Success Multipliers:** Designed to yield **>40%** in an upside scenario.
- **Probability of Success (from Metaculus):** Let's assume a conservative **70%**.
- **Upside Scenario (70% probability):** The \$27B treasury is established. The bond pays its high yield, backed by government receivables. Return = **\$4M+**. The associated governance tokens unlock value orders of magnitude higher.
- **Downside Scenario (30% probability):** The initiative fails. First-loss/guarantee capital absorbs initial losses, but principal is at risk. Return = **\$0**.

**Calculating Expected Value:**
- `EV = (Probability of Success * Upside) + (Probability of Failure * Downside)`
- `EV (Bond Yield Only) = (0.70 * $14,000,000) + (0.30 * $0) = $9,800,000`

### The Master Equation for Outperformance

To be the world's best investment, the Risk-Adjusted Expected Value (`EV_victory`) must exceed the benchmark (`EV_benchmark`).

The formula is:
\[ (P_{\text{success}} \times V_{\text{upside}}) + (P_{\text{failure}} \times V_{\text{downside}}) > V_{\text{initial}} \times (1 + R_{\text{benchmark}}) \]

**1. Calculate the Benchmark's Expected Value:**
An investor putting \$10M into the Medallion Fund expects a value of:
\[ EV_{\text{benchmark}} = \$10,000,000 \times (1 + 0.39) = \mathbf{\$13,900,000} \]

**2. Solve for the Required Upside Value (`V_upside`):**
Using our 70% success probability, we must deliver an upside value greater than the benchmark's EV:
\[ (0.70 \times V_{\text{upside}}) + (0.30 \times \$0) > \$13,900,000 \]
\[ V_{\text{upside}} > \frac{\$13,900,000}{0.70} \]
\[ V_{\text{upside}} > \mathbf{\$19,857,143} \]

**3. Calculate the Required ROI:**
This means the net profit in a success scenario must be \$9,857,143. The required ROI is therefore:
\[ \text{ROI}_{\text{needed}} = \left( \frac{\$19,857,143 - \$10,000,000}{\$10,000,000} \right) \times 100 = \mathbf{98.57\%} \]

This calculation proves that to be statistically superior to the world's best fund, our success scenario must deliver a return of nearly 100%. A simple bond yield cannot achieve this.

**Making it Competitive: The Governance Token Alpha**
The bond yield alone does not beat the Medallion benchmark. The critical factor is the **governance power over the \$27B annual treasury**. This is the ultimate source of alpha for our investors.

Unlike any other fund, our investors are buying control of a perpetual, multi-billion-dollar capital allocation engine. The financial value of this governance—to direct research, fund companies, and shape the future of global health—is an uncapped upside with no equivalent in traditional finance. It is this "Governance Token Alpha" that is designed to deliver the **~99%+ ROI** required for outperformance.

**Our Target:** We will structure the tranches of \$VICTORY bonds and their associated governance token allocations to ensure that the total risk-adjusted expected value for early investors is **at least 1% higher** than the Medallion Fund's 39% net annualized return. This is the core financial promise of the project.

**Conclusion:** By structuring returns with success multipliers and the unprecedented value of treasury governance, the risk-adjusted expected value of an early investment in \$VICTORY Bonds is designed to be mathematically superior to the returns of even the most elite hedge funds.

## 9. Engineered for Superior Returns: Leveraging High-ROI Lobbying Dynamics

$VICTORY Bonds are designed to deliver risk-adjusted returns superior to alternative investments by harnessing the extraordinary ROI dynamics of lobbying seen in fossil fuel and military industries—while redirecting them toward positive health outcomes.

### Benchmark: Exceptional ROI in Policy-Influenced Sectors
- Fossil fuel lobbying generates average returns of **[800%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/27/fossil-fuel-industry-lobbying-roi-return-on-investment)**, with companies like ExxonMobil spending $27 million on lobbying in 2020 to secure $220 million in benefits.
- Military contractors achieve similar multiples; for every $1 spent on lobbying, they secure **[over $100 in contracts](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2022/ProfitsWar)**, as seen with Lockheed Martin's $14 million in 2023 lobbying yielding $70.8 billion in revenue.

These returns arise from influencing policy to capture public funds, creating stable revenue streams backed by government budgets.

### How $VICTORY Bonds Achieve Superior Returns
We adapt this model for positive impact: $VICTORY Bonds fund a reallocation of 1% of global military spending ($27+ billion annually) to health via the 1% Treaty. This enables:
- **High Leverage on Advocacy**: A $1 investment could yield $100–$1,000+ in treasury inflows, exceeding traditional benchmarks through global scale and democratic support.
- **Dynamic Risk Pricing**: Metaculus predictions allow us to adjust bond terms, targeting EV at least 1% above elite funds (e.g., 99%+ ROI in success scenarios).
- **Governance Value**: Bondholders access control over a perpetual $27B treasury, providing ongoing value beyond fixed yields—surpassing one-off contract gains.

By leveraging policy influence for societal benefit, $VICTORY Bonds are structured to offer returns superior to alternative investments in high-ROI sectors.

### How We Talk About Returns (Standardized Language)
Under the proposed Impact Securities framework, we present return objectives as targets, not guarantees:
- **Objective:** Target risk‑adjusted returns competitive with leading alternatives.
- **Payout Source:** Capped share of verified treaty inflows and/or measured savings, disclosed ex‑ante.
- **Transparency:** Real‑time on‑chain disclosures of coverage ratios, covenants, and use of proceeds.
- **Risks:** Political adoption, execution, and timing risks may reduce or eliminate payouts.
For compliance details, see [Impact Securities and Digital Public Goods Financing Act (Draft)](../regulatory/impact-securities-reform.md#section-4a-marketing--disclosures-safe-harbor-plain-english-outcome-linked).

### The Peace Dividend: The Ultimate Source of Value
The financial returns for $VICTORY instruments are sourced from the $27B annual treasury. However, the ultimate economic underpinning of this investment is the **$16.5 trillion annual Peace Dividend** unlocked by the treaty. This represents the total value reclaimed from conflict, with over 99% flowing to global society. For a detailed breakdown of this value capture model, see [The Peace Dividend: Value Capture & Distribution Model](./peace-dividend-value-capture.md).

## 10. Assessing Realism: Risks, Repayment Timeline, and Contingencies

While the $VICTORY Bonds model draws on historical precedents like World War II War Bonds and proven lobbying ROI dynamics, its success involves significant uncertainties. This section provides a balanced view, including phased repayment and risk mitigations.

### Repayment Timeline
Repayment is tied to 1% Treaty inflows rather than fixed dates, as detailed in [\$VICTORY Instruments Tokenomics](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/victory-bonds-tokenomics.md):
- **Short-Term (Years 1-2)**: Initial coupons (2–6% floating) paid from reserves, philanthropic inflows, or early program cash flows.
- **Medium-Term (Years 3-5)**: Amortization begins 18–36 months after first major treaty ratification, with annual inflows of $27B+ covering principal and yields.
- **Long-Term (5-10 Years)**: Full maturity, plus ongoing value from governance tokens over the perpetual DIH Treasury (see [Decentralized Institutes of Health](../strategy/1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md)).
- **Partial Success Example**: With 5 countries participating, $8.5B annual inflows enable 3.4X return on a $2.5B investment in Year 1 post-ratification.

### Key Risks and Mitigations
- **Political Adoption Risk**: Treaty ratification depends on global referendum success (target: 3.5% of population, ~280M votes). Mitigation: Dynamic pricing via Metaculus markets adjusts yields (e.g., higher for early tranches if probability <70%); fallback to philanthropic funding.
- **Execution and Regulatory Risk**: Building the DIH Treasury involves compliance across jurisdictions. Mitigation: Staggered launches with Reg CF/A/S exemptions, on-chain audits, and automated covenant checks (as in tokenomics).
- **Financial Risk**: If inflows delay, principal could be at risk. Mitigation: Seniority waterfalls, optional reinsurance, and first-loss capital absorb initial losses; public dashboards track coverage ratios.
- **Overall Probability**: Metaculus forecasts will provide real-time estimates; historical analogs (e.g., war bonds raised $185B adjusted) suggest feasibility, but failure rate could be 30%+ without momentum.

### Appeal to Philanthropic Investors
Philanthropic funds can achieve extraordinary impact multiplication through $VICTORY Bonds, leveraging advocacy to redirect public budgets at scales far beyond direct grants.
- **Quantitative Leverage**: A $1M investment could unlock $1B in health funding via treaty inflows, offering 1,000X impact—compared to ~10X for high-impact charities like malaria prevention.
- **Alignment with Effective Altruism**: This mirrors EA principles of high-ROI interventions, potentially saving more lives per dollar than traditional aid (e.g., equivalent to funding 10,000+ years of research).
- **Risk-Adjusted Giving**: Metaculus pricing allows donors to target high-probability tranches, with governance rights ensuring funds align with impact goals.

  > "Top charities like AMF provide ~10X return in lives saved per dollar compared to cash transfers."
  > — GiveWell, 2023, [Cost-Effectiveness](https://www.givewell.org/research/intervention-reports/bednets)

### Targeting Defense Contractors as Investors
$VICTORY Bonds are uniquely positioned to target defense contractors as primary investors. By offering superior risk-adjusted returns (as modeled above), we incentivize them to repurpose their lobbying networks to support the 1% Treaty—turning potential adversaries into allies.

We have 85-90% confidence this co-opting approach is superior to adversarial strategies, based on game theory and precedents. For full analysis, see [Co-Opting Defense Contractors](../co-opting-defense-contractors.md).
