# DIH Treasury: 10-Year Cash Flow & Payout Model

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a clear, year-over-year financial model for the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) treasury for the first decade of its operation post-treaty ratification. It demonstrates how the DIH can sustainably repay the initial "activation energy" investors with a world-class **10x return** while retaining the vast majority of its funding to execute its mission.

The model projects that over 10 years, after paying out **\$25 billion** to investors (a 10x return on the initial \$2.5B), the DIH will have **\$245 billion** in net funds remaining to invest in curing diseases.

## 2. Core Assumptions

This model is based on the following high-level assumptions derived from other strategic documents:
-   **Total Activation Energy Raised:** \$2.5 billion.
-   **Annual Treasury Inflow (from 1% Treaty):** \$27 billion, starting in Year 1.
-   **Investor Repayment Term:** Principal and returns are paid out over a 10-year period.
-   **Target Investor Return:** The model uses our public-facing target of a **10x return** (\$25B total payout on \$2.5B invested). This is equivalent to a ~26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), a world-class return.

## 3. Investor Payout Model

To provide a concrete example, we model a simple 10-year linear payout schedule.

-   **Total Payout:** \$25 billion
-   **Annual Payout:** `\$25B / 10 years =` **\$2.5 billion per year**.

## 4. 10-Year Projected Cash Flow Table

The following table details the flow of funds for the first decade.

| Year | Annual Inflow (A) | Annual Investor Payout (B) | **Net Funds for DIH Mission (A - B)** | Cumulative Investor Payout | Cumulative DIH Funds |

## 5. Conclusion & Key Takeaways

This model makes two things abundantly clear:

1.  **A 10x Investor Return is Highly Sustainable:** The DIH can comfortably pay out **\$25 billion** to its initial backers—a 1000% return over 10 years—using only **9.26%** of its total income during that period.
2.  **Vast Resources Remain for the Mission:** After fully rewarding its investors with a historic return, the DIH is projected to have nearly a **quarter of a trillion dollars (\$245 billion)** in net funds to allocate to patient subsidies, research prizes, and ecosystem development.

**Note on Long-Term Growth:** This projection uses a conservative, static \$27 billion annual inflow. Our long-term strategy, [The Endgame](./../strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md), is to incrementally increase the redirection percentage over time. This represents a significant potential upside not captured in this 10-year model, as the DIH treasury is designed to grow perpetually.

This robust financial model proves that we can create a powerful, self-sustaining engine for global health that aligns the interests of investors with the interests of all humanity.
