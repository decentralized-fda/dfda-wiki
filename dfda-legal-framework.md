## 1. Network of State-Level Agencies

- Create a network of state-level FDA agencies, each with authority over their jurisdiction.
- Federal FDA becomes a coordinating body, setting minimum standards and facilitating inter-state cooperation.

## 2. Specialized Divisions

- Break down the FDA into specialized divisions for different product categories (e.g., pharmaceuticals, medical devices, food safety).
- Each division operates semi-autonomously with its own review processes and experts.

## 3. Blockchain-Based Decision Making

- Implement a blockchain-based voting system for major regulatory decisions.
- Qualified experts from academia, industry, and government can participate in decision-making processes.

## 4. Open Data and Transparency

- Create an open data platform where all non-confidential regulatory data is publicly accessible.
- Use distributed ledger technology to ensure data integrity and traceability.

## 5. AI-Assisted Review Process

- Develop AI systems to assist in the initial screening of applications and adverse event reports.
- Human experts make final decisions, but AI streamlines the process.

## 6. Decentralized Clinical Trials

- Establish a framework for decentralized clinical trials using telemedicine and wearable devices.
- This allows for more diverse patient populations and faster data collection.

## 7. Community Engagement

- Create local community boards that provide input on regulatory decisions affecting their areas.
- These boards can flag local concerns and provide context for regulatory decisions.

## 8. Incentive Structure

- Implement a token-based incentive system to reward participants who contribute to the regulatory process (e.g., reviewing applications, reporting adverse events).

## 9. Inter-Agency Collaboration

- Establish protocols for seamless collaboration with other decentralized regulatory bodies (e.g., EPA, USDA) on overlapping issues.

## 10. Global Interoperability

- Design the system to be interoperable with international regulatory bodies, facilitating global harmonization of standards.

## Legal Framework

- Amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow for this decentralized structure.
- Create a new "Decentralized FDA Act" that outlines the legal basis for this new structure, including:
  - Jurisdiction of state-level agencies
  - Authority of the blockchain-based voting system
  - Legal standing of AI-assisted decisions
  - Privacy protections for open data
  - Liability frameworks in this decentralized model
