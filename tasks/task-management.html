<p>Before creating a task, search for some keywords to make sure we don't have one for that already. This will help to avoid duplication of effort.</p>
<p>Lab Coordinators should always set the Importance, Urgency, and Time Estimates.</p>
<p>If the task doer disagrees and thinks the estimates/pay should be higher, they should comment with their estimates. If the Lab Coordinator feels the task is worth the increased cost, then they should update the estimates. If the task is not with the increased cost, then it should let open for someone else who's willing to do it at the current estimate or an alternative amount can be evaluated.</p>
<p>When completing a task, be sure to attach a link or file to the deliverable of the task.</p>
