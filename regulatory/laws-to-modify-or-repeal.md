# Laws for Potential Modification or Repeal

This list identifies specific U.S. federal laws (statutes) that could be considered for modification or repeal to significantly reduce the cost and time required to bring new medical interventions to patients, particularly through the use of a large-scale, automated, decentralized clinical trial platform (dFDA concept). Addressing these requires legislative action by Congress.

* **Anti-Kickback Statute (42 USC ยง 1320a-7b(b)) & Stark Law (42 USC ยง 1395nn):**
    * *Area for Review:* Potential conflicts with compensating patients for data contributions or trial participation facilitated through the platform, or incentives for providers to utilize the platform.
    * *Potential Modifications:* Establish clear statutory safe harbors clarifying permissible compensation structures for patient participation and data contribution in platform-based trials. Ensure platform usage incentives align with value-based care principles rather than prohibited inducements.

* **User Fee Acts (PDUFA, GDUFA, MDUFA, BsUFA):**
    * *Area for Review:* Reliance on industry user fees for FDA funding, potentially creating misaligned incentives and conflicts with proposals for alternative funding or eliminating fees.
    * *Potential Modifications:* Explore and legislate alternative FDA funding models (e.g., increased direct appropriation, platform subscription fees, outcome-based payments) that reduce reliance on traditional user fees, particularly for products primarily evaluated via the dFDA platform. Align funding mechanisms with the goals of broad access and lower costs.

* **Intellectual Property & Data Exclusivity Rules (e.g., Hatch-Waxman Act provisions, Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act):**
    * *Area for Review:* Potential conflict between existing market/data exclusivity periods for approved drugs/biologics and the dFDA model of continuous, open data sharing and real-time evaluation from the outset.
    * *Potential Modifications:* Develop alternative statutory incentive structures or modify exclusivity rules to align with the platform model. Explore models that reward data generation and sharing on the platform, or tiered exclusivity based on the robustness of platform-generated evidence. Ensure IP frameworks don't inadvertently block the analysis or sharing of aggregated, anonymized data generated via the platform.

* **Definition/Standard of "Marketing Approval" (Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act - FD&C Act):**
    * *Area for Review:* The binary nature of "approval" versus the dFDA concept of continuous evidence generation, ranking, and probabilistic outcomes. How does this impact market access, reimbursement, and permitted communication under the FD&C Act?
    * *Potential Modifications:* Amend the FD&C Act to explore regulatory frameworks that move beyond a single "approval" point. Define statutory thresholds or standards based on platform-generated evidence (e.g., confidence intervals, effectiveness ranking) that permit different levels of market access, reimbursement eligibility, or communication about treatment benefits/risks.

* **Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA):**
    * *Area for Review:* Separate regulatory pathway allowing structure/function claims with lower evidence standards; hinders unified evaluation.
    * *Potential Modifications:* Modify or repeal DSHEA to integrate dietary supplements into the main dFDA evaluation framework, requiring them to be assessed based on the same evidence standards as foods and drugs via the platform. Phase out the separate DSHEA pathway for products evaluated on the platform.

* **Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA):**
    * *Area for Review:* Application of lab certification requirements (established by statute) to diverse testing environments used in DCTs (e.g., home testing kits, local non-research labs, point-of-care testing).
    * *Potential Modifications:* Amend CLIA to create clear pathways or waivers for tests used within validated dFDA platform protocols. Establish statutory standards for ensuring quality and reliability of results from diverse, decentralized testing sources integrated with the platform.

* **Controlled Substances Act (CSA):**
    * *Area for Review:* Statutory restrictions on prescribing and dispensing controlled substances across state lines or via telemedicine, hindering evaluation of these substances in DCTs.
    * *Potential Modifications:* Amend the CSA to create specific exemptions or pathways for the prescribing and direct-to-patient dispensing of controlled substances used as investigational products within registered dFDA platform trials. Ensure appropriate security, tracking, and reporting mechanisms are integrated into the platform.

* **Orphan Drug Act (ODA):**
    * *Area for Review:* Alignment of existing statutory incentives (e.g., market exclusivity, tax credits) with the potentially faster and cheaper evidence generation possible on the dFDA platform for rare diseases.
    * *Potential Modifications:* Re-evaluate and potentially amend ODA incentives to match the dFDA paradigm. Explore alternative statutory incentives rewarding efficient evidence generation or successful treatment identification for rare diseases via the platform.
