**TLDR**  

| **Metric** | **Current System** | **Proposed dFDA System** | **Source** |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Annual trial capacity (NIH-funded) | ~1.2M participants ($51B ÷ $41k/patient) | **61M+ participants** ($30.6B redirected ÷ $500/patient) | [1,3] |
| Per-patient trial cost | $41,413 (median) | **$500** (RECOVERY Trial model) | [1,2] |
| Time-to-patient access | 10-15 years | <2 years via perpetual trials | – |
| Potential longevity participants | Limited by disease classification | **Unlimited** (patient-driven endpoints) | – |
| Regulatory compliance path | N/A | **21 CFR 312.8** enables immediate cost recovery | [8] |

**Key Numbers**  
1. **83x cost efficiency** - Treat 61M vs 1.2M patients with same funds  
2. **$2T annual savings** from accelerated development ([JAMA](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295430/))  
3. **0 legislative changes** - Uses existing:  
   - FDA cost-recovery rules ([21 CFR 312.8](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312/section-312.8))  
   - Medicare/Medicaid trial coverage ([CMS Policy](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coverage/approved-facilities-trials-registries/clinical-policies))  
4. **100M+ additional participants** through Medicare/Medicaid integration

# Executive Summary

This proposal recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sponsor an **FDA-X Prize** to incentivize the creation of an **open-source, decentralized FDA (dFDA)** platform. This platform would enable **perpetual, patient-driven clinical trials** accessible to anyone globally, eliminating inefficiencies in the current phased trial system. The proposal outlines strategies for **redirecting NIH research funding**, **leveraging existing HHS authorities**, and **adopting outcome-based funding models** to maximize trial participation without requiring new legislation. Additionally, it proposes the **strategic reallocation of portions of Medicare and Medicaid funding** under existing statutory provisions to support broader access to decentralized trials.

A critical component of this proposal is to **clarify the potential for drug companies to set a per-participant price** when creating trials on the dFDA platform. Under existing **FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.8)**, companies may charge for investigational drugs to recover direct costs, including employee salaries, without generating profit. This means that **drug companies could legally charge the NIH a per-participant price** covering all operational expenses—such as manufacturing, distribution, and employee compensation—**without requiring pre-approval**, provided they do not exceed cost-recovery limits. This structure would enable companies to sustain clinical trial operations while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards, promoting a scalable and sustainable ecosystem for perpetual trials.

Moreover, **existing Medicare and Medicaid policies** already permit reimbursement for routine patient costs in qualifying clinical trials. By aligning the dFDA platform's operational structure with these statutory frameworks, **drug companies could expand access to experimental treatments** without profit margins, leveraging government funding mechanisms to cover essential costs. This approach ensures that trial sponsors can sustainably conduct large-scale studies while maintaining affordability and regulatory compliance.

# Key Objectives

1. **Create a Decentralized FDA (dFDA) Platform:** An open-source infrastructure enabling continuous, patient-centric trials.  
2. **Enable Perpetual Trials:** Allow real-time, global patient participation in ongoing trials without traditional regulatory bottlenecks.  
3. **Clarify Pricing Mechanisms for Trial Sponsors:** Allow drug companies to set per-participant prices charged to NIH, covering direct costs (including employee salaries) without profit generation, consistent with **FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.8)**.  
4. **Redirect NIH Research Funding:** Transition NIH-funded research toward projects leveraging the dFDA system ([NIH Budget](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2025-budget-in-brief.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
5. **Leverage Medicare and Medicaid for Trial Access:** Utilize existing statutory provisions allowing beneficiaries to participate in qualifying clinical trials ([CMS Medicare Policy](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coverage/approved-facilities-trials-registries/clinical-policies?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Medicaid Clinical Trial Coverage Act](https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd21005.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
6. **Incentivize Innovation via FDA-X Prize:** Launch a $500 million X Prize competition to develop and deploy the dFDA platform.  
7. **Expand Adaptive and Pragmatic Trials:** Use NIH funding and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements to sponsor scalable adaptive trials, ensuring cost-effective and real-world data generation.  
8. **Government Co-Funding and Outcome-Based Payment Models:** Utilize milestone-based payments and alternative payment models through CMMI to incentivize private-sector participation.

# HHS Budget Context and Reallocation Potential

- **Total HHS Budget (FY 2025):** $1.843 trillion ([HHS Budget Overview](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2025-budget-in-brief.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
  - **Medicare and Medicaid:** Constitute **85%** of total outlays ([FAS Report](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R48060.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
  - **HRSA:** Allocated $16.3 billion (\~0.9% of total budget) ([HRSA Budget Justification](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/about/budget/budget-justification-fy2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Given the size of the Medicare and Medicaid budgets and existing statutory permissions, **redirecting even a fraction of these funds to dFDA trials could enable participation for tens of millions of patients** without legislative changes. Furthermore, **NIH reimbursements to drug companies for cost-recovery-based per-participant pricing** would align with **FDA regulations**, ensuring compliance and operational sustainability.

# Potential Participant Capacity with Proposed Funding

Given the **$30.6 billion** annual allocation for perpetual and adaptive trial execution and referencing the **Oxford RECOVERY Trial's per-patient cost of \~$500** ([RECOVERY Trial Cost](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Meeting-Summary-RECOVERY-Trial.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), the proposed funding could support:

- **Over 61 million participants annually** (**$30.6B ÷ $500 per participant**).

**Medicare/Medicaid Integration Potential:**

- Existing policies allow for Medicare and Medicaid funds to cover routine patient costs in clinical trials. **Expanding this coverage to dFDA trials could support an additional 100+ million participants annually**, given the combined scale of these programs.  
- **Per-participant pricing by trial sponsors**, structured for cost recovery and compliant with [**21 CFR 312.8**](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312/subpart-A/section-312.8), could further enhance trial scalability without the need for pre-approval.
