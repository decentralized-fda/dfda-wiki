<ol>
  <li>There is something about gameplay that is hardwired into the human brain.</li>
  <li>We love progressing, getting awards, ranking on leaderboards, badges, finishing tasks, leveling up, and having fun while doing it.</li>
  <li>People only consume what entertains them.<ol>
      <li>An example is the “Michelin Guide”.<ol>
          <li>They produced the “ultimate guide for new motorists” in 1900 to help promote their tire business, which wasn’t selling a lot.</li>
          <li>They constantly improved it and by 1930, it was a regular on the France bestseller list and the brand “Michelin” became a prominent brand.</li>
          <li>Now, the brothers never needed to worry about selling their tires ever again.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Include a bar that shows people that they have completed 20%, 50%, etc. E.g. of the onboarding process<ol>
      <li>This prompts us to get to 100% because we hate not finishing something.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Awards.<ol>
      <li>E.g., for participating in 1, 3, 5, 10 events, etc.</li>
      <li>Completing 1 task, 3, 5, 10, etc.</li>
      <li>Submitting 1, 3, 5, 10, etc. usable ideas, etc.</li>
      <li>Onboarding 1 contributor, 2 contributors, 3 contributors, 4 contributors, 5 contributors, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><i>Leaderboards</i>.</li>
  <li>Combining the awards with leaderboards.</li>
  <li>If we let someone know that they are in 3rd place for most tasks in a working group, there is a good chance they’ll take action to get in 2nd place.</li>
  <li>The same could go for the rest of the awards.</li>
</ol>
