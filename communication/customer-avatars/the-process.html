<ol>
  <li>To tailor-make our community initiatives to maximize impact:<ol>
      <li>Passionate individuals</li>
      <li>Excitement about our mission and vision</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Who is our market? Do we really know? Have we truly assessed our consumer motivations and expectations?</li>
  <li>How should these constituencies be best served? Have we mobilized the best data and ideas from our community?</li>
  <li>Invite users to regular 1-on-1’s and group “feedback/get to know the team” calls<ol>
      <li>Request them to go through the charter beforehand</li>
      <li>Ask each person to share a little story about who they are and why they’re here:<ol>
          <li>What are the things that motivate you?</li>
          <li>Why do you get out of bed each morning?</li>
          <li>What are they here on this earth to do?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Keep asking questions in order to understand their entire “user journey”<ol>
          <li>How did you find us?</li>
          <li>What is your current perception of what we are doing?</li>
          <li>What do you think we should do differently?<ol>
              <li>Ask them to get specific. This is a safe space.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>How can you help achieve our mission?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Ask, “How can we help you?”<ol>
          <li>With the expectation that not all requests will be fulfilled</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Drill down on specific questions that relate to future features<ol>
          <li>Get our users to imagine, explain, or test real-life scenarios about the product</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Get them to take action<ol>
          <li>Define next steps<ol>
              <li>E.g. giving them a task to get started</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Ask them to fill out the Notion form if they haven't</li>
          <li>Assign them to a lab/s</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Our community might have multiple different “categories” of users who share similar motivations, goals, and frustrations/problems</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>It's a great starting point, but customer personas are no longer enough on its own.</li>
  <li>Once we know the demographics, psychographics, and other details that a typical persona provides, we need to keep digging.<ol>
      <li>The goal now is to figure out how each potential customer thinks and what they value.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Each person that fits a particular customer persona might share similarities.<ol>
      <li>But numerous variables come into play that results in important differences — for example, industry.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Let's say our top persona is a female executive. In a purchasing role, between age 30 and 40, with a $100,000 median income.<ol>
      <li>If that woman is in the manufacturing industry, she's going to have drastically different priorities from those of the same persona in the tech industry.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Furthermore, we should consider the organizational size.<ol>
      <li>Even if two target buyers fit the same persona and are in the same industry, they still don't necessarily value the same things.</li>
      <li>For instance, one might be in a tech startup, whereas the other is in an enterprise software company.<ol>
          <li>Their worlds are millions of miles apart, and they'll need different content that speaks to different issues.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>There are other variables in addition to those (e.g., geography) that affect how personas think and what they value.<ol>
      <li>It's our job to get as nuanced and specific as possible, based on all of those criteria, before trying to create and share the right content.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Go through and tag every single piece of content based on persona, stage of the buyer journey, industry, company size, geography, and so forth.</li>
  <li>By the time we're done, we should be able to quickly pull a deeply relevant, personalized piece of content for just about anyone.</li>
</ol>
