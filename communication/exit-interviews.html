<ol>
  <li>When someone leaves the DAO, goes for long periods of time being inactive, or generally shows themselves to not be retained, then we have an opportunity to learn from them.</li>
  <li>Contact them and ask why</li>
  <li>That can also be a chance to bring them back.<ol>
      <li>E.g., offer them something exclusive</li>
      <li>If we have already lost them, we might as well try something to bring them back.</li>
    </ol>
