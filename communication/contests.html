<ol>
  <li>Prizes that are meaningful to the audience.</li>
  <li>Give them something that represents us.</li>
  <li>Giveaway experiences, not just goods and services.</li>
  <li>E.g. event tickets to healthy longevity, biohacking, health data, and web 3 conferences.</li>
  <li>At least prize for first, second, and third place.<ol>
      <li>Ideally also an incentive for participating</li>
      <li>People want to feel like they have a chance of winning, and if you only have a grand prize, then they might not play along.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Give them more entries to win the contest based on how much they give us in exchange.<ol>
      <li>For an email address, they get one entry.</li>
      <li>If they get a person to join our Discord, they get 1 more entry.</li>
      <li>For a share, they might get 3 more entries.</li>
      <li>If they get a new contributor on board, they get 6 more entries</li>
      <li>If they get another person to join the contest, they get 1 more entry, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Ideally, we run it for about a month.</li>
  <li>Make it a big deal when we announce the winners and use this occasion as another event that generates noise and traffic.</li>
</ol>
