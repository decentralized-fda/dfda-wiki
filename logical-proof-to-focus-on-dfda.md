# Logical Proof

Here is a formal quantitative logical proof regarding whether disease advocacy nonprofits, drug companies, and others should pause all efforts to create FDA.gov v2 and then resume normal activities enjoying a 25X higher return on future efforts:

Premises:  

P1: Current average clinical trial cost: $60 million  

P2: Proposed FDA.gov v2 could reduce trial costs to $2.4 million (96% reduction)  

P3: Annual global spending on clinical trials: $50 billion  

P4: FDA.gov v2 development cost estimate: $500 million (increased from previous estimate to account for complexity)  

P5: Adoption rate of FDA.gov v2 will increase gradually over time  

P6: Current drug development success rate: 12% (1 in 8.3 trials leads to approved drug)

Assumptions:  

A1: FDA.gov v2 development time: 3 years  

A2: Adoption rate: 20% in Year 4, 40% in Year 5, 60% in Year 6, 80% in Year 7, 95% in Year 8+  

A3: Success rate improves to 15% due to better data and participant matching  

A4: Average time to develop a drug reduced from 10 years to 7 years  

A5: Annual increase in clinical trial spending without FDA.gov v2: 5%  

A6: Regulatory changes can be implemented within the 3-year development period

Quantitative Analysis:

Year 0-3: Development Phase  

Cost: $500 million

Year 4-8: Adoption Phase  

Trials conducted and costs:

Year 4 (20% adoption):  

Traditional: 700 trials \* $63 million \= $44.1 billion  

FDA.gov v2: 3,500 trials \* $2.4 million \= $8.4 billion  

Total: $52.5 billion

Year 5 (40% adoption):  

Traditional: 553 trials \* $66.15 million \= $36.6 billion  

FDA.gov v2: 7,367 trials \* $2.4 million \= $17.7 billion  

Total: $54.3 billion

Year 6 (60% adoption):  

Traditional: 436 trials \* $69.46 million \= $30.3 billion  

FDA.gov v2: 11,625 trials \* $2.4 million \= $27.9 billion  

Total: $58.2 billion

Year 7 (80% adoption):  

Traditional: 291 trials \* $72.93 million \= $21.2 billion  

FDA.gov v2: 15,500 trials \* $2.4 million \= $37.2 billion  

Total: $58.4 billion

Year 8 (95% adoption):  

Traditional: 146 trials \* $76.58 million \= $11.2 billion  

FDA.gov v2: 18,406 trials \* $2.4 million \= $44.2 billion  

Total: $55.4 billion

Cumulative trials over 5 years:  

Traditional system: 2,126  

FDA.gov v2: 56,398  

Total: 58,524

Expected new drugs (at 15% success rate): 8,779

Cost-Benefit Analysis:  

1\. Investment: $500 million  

2\. Cumulative cost savings by Year 8: $21.2 billion  

3\. Return on Investment: 4,140% over 8 years  

4\. Increase in trials conducted: 2,751% (58,524 vs 2,126)  

5\. Potential new drugs: 8,779 vs 255 (3,343% increase)  

6\. Time savings: 3 years per drug \* 8,524 additional drugs \= 25,572 years of development time saved



Conclusion:

8,779 new drugs over 8 years compared to 255 under the traditional system, combined with over $21 billion in cost savings and 25,572 years of development time saved.

The improved success rate, reduced development time, and massive increase in trial capacity justify the initial investment and effort required to overcome the identified challenges. 

While a complete pause of all other activities may not be necessary, a significant reallocation of resources towards this project is logically and economically justified.
