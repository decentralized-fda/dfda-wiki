# A Logical Proof That We Should Immediately Create A Decentralized FDA

Here is a formal quantitative logical proof regarding whether disease advocacy nonprofits, drug companies, and others should pause all efforts to create FDA.gov v2 and then resume normal activities enjoying a 25X higher return on future efforts:

## Key Premises

| Premise | Description | Value |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | Current average clinical trial cost | $60 million |
| P2 | Proposed FDA.gov v2 trial cost | $2.4 million (96% reduction) |
| P3 | Annual global spending on trials | $50 billion |
| P4 | FDA.gov v2 development cost | $500 million |
| P5 | Adoption rate | Gradual increase over time |
| P6 | Current drug development success rate | 12% (1 in 8.3 trials) |

## Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Description | Value |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| A1 | FDA.gov v2 development time | 3 years |
| A2 | Adoption rate progression | Y4: 20%, Y5: 40%, Y6: 60%, Y7: 80%, Y8+: 95% |
| A3 | Improved success rate | 15% |
| A4 | Drug development time reduction | From 10 years to 7 years |
| A5 | Annual trial spending increase (without v2) | 5% |
| A6 | Regulatory implementation timeline | Within 3-year development period |

## Quantitative Analysis

### Development Phase (Years 0-3)
- **Total Cost**: $500 million

### Adoption Phase (Years 4-8)

#### Year 4 (20% Adoption)
- **Traditional**: 700 trials × $63M = $44.1B
- **FDA.gov v2**: 3,500 trials × $2.4M = $8.4B
- **Total**: $52.5B

#### Year 5 (40% Adoption)
- **Traditional**: 553 trials × $66.15M = $36.6B
- **FDA.gov v2**: 7,367 trials × $2.4M = $17.7B
- **Total**: $54.3B

#### Year 6 (60% Adoption)
- **Traditional**: 436 trials × $69.46M = $30.3B
- **FDA.gov v2**: 11,625 trials × $2.4M = $27.9B
- **Total**: $58.2B

#### Year 7 (80% Adoption)
- **Traditional**: 291 trials × $72.93M = $21.2B
- **FDA.gov v2**: 15,500 trials × $2.4M = $37.2B
- **Total**: $58.4B

#### Year 8 (95% Adoption)
- **Traditional**: 146 trials × $76.58M = $11.2B
- **FDA.gov v2**: 18,406 trials × $2.4M = $44.2B
- **Total**: $55.4B

## Impact Summary

### Trial Volume
- **Traditional System**: 2,126 trials
- **FDA.gov v2**: 56,398 trials
- **Total**: 58,524 trials

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Investment | $500 million |
| Cumulative Cost Savings (Year 8) | $21.2 billion |
| ROI (8 years) | 4,140% |
| Trial Volume Increase | 2,751% |
| New Drugs (Traditional) | 255 |
| New Drugs (FDA.gov v2) | 8,779 |
| Development Time Saved | 25,572 years |

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates compelling evidence for prioritizing FDA.gov v2:

1. **Drug Development**: 8,779 new drugs vs 255 under traditional system
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Over $21 billion in savings
3. **Time Savings**: 25,572 years of development time saved

While complete pause of other activities may not be necessary, significant resource reallocation towards this project is both logically and economically justified.
