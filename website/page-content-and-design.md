# Website Content and Design: War on Disease

This document outlines the content and design specifications for the "War on Disease" landing page, based on the `app/page.tsx` file. The design is implemented using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## General Styling

- **Fonts:** The page primarily uses a `serif` font family, specified by `font-serif`. Text is often bold (`font-bold`) and uppercase (`uppercase`).
- **Colors:** The color palette is minimalistic, mainly using black (`bg-black`, `text-black`, `border-black`) and white (`bg-white`, `text-white`, `border-white`). The default background is `bg-background`.
- **Borders:** A heavy `border-4` or `border-b-4` with `border-black` or `border-white` is used frequently to create a stark, high-contrast look.
- **Layout:** The main content is contained within a `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-5xl` container, centered with `mx-auto`. Sections have significant vertical padding (e.g., `py-24`, `py-32`).
