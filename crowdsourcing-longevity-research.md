# Objective

To develop an experimental protocol for crowdsourcing longevity research for a random intervention and collecting outcome data to characterize the participant's overall health status using affordable and valuable collection methods, such as Withings blood pressure monitor, Withings scale, and Fitbit.

# Target Population

Biohackers interested in longevity research.

# Methodology

## 1. **Recruitment of Participants**
Recruit biohackers interested in longevity research through online forums, social media platforms, and meetup groups related to artificial intelligence and decentralized autonomous organizations. Ensure that participants provide informed consent before participating in the study.

## 2. Experiment Design Options

**A. Random Intervention**: Randomly assign participants to the intervention or control groups. The intervention group will receive a specific treatment or lifestyle modification to promote longevity, while the control group will continue their usual routine.

**B. Single Group Pre-Post A/B Test Design:** Instead of splitting participants into groups, all participants will undergo the same intervention. The study will be conducted in two phases:

- **Baseline Phase** (~3 months): During this phase, participants will continue their usual routine without any intervention. Data will be collected to establish baseline health status.
- **Intervention Phase** (~3 months): After the baseline phase, participants will receive the intervention aimed at promoting longevity. Data will be collected during this phase to assess the impact of the intervention on the participants' health status.

## 3. **Data Collection**
Collect baseline data from all participants using the following methods:

**Manual Collection**

The use of any interventions, diet, and patient-reported outcomes can be done with [app.curedao.org](https://app.curedao.org/app/public) by [creating daily reminders](https://app.curedao.org/app/public/#/app/reminder-search) and [recording in the inbox](https://app.curedao.org/app/public/#/app/reminders-inbox) or with the web and mobile push notifications with action buttons.

**Spreadsheet Collection**

A spreadsheet can also be used to manually record data. [Here's an example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SozM09nGi_kejbJ4IdeAhA_ZVGY1WMR_myGX2FB1Rb8/edit#gid=0) illustrating the ideal format.


**Automated Collection**

Data can be automatically imported from various wearable devices on the [import data page](https://app.curedao.org/app/public/#/app/import)

Recommended options for automated data collection include:

## 4. **Intervention Period**
Implement the assigned intervention for a predetermined period, such as 12 weeks. Encourage participants to track their progress as described in step 3.

## 5. **Data Analysis**
Analyze the collected data to determine the impact of the intervention on the participant's overall health status. Compare the pre- and post-intervention data within each group and between the intervention and control groups.  This is typicially done on an ongoing basis and should be discoverable by selecting a predictor and outcome on the [study creation page](https://app.curedao.org/app/public/#/app/study-creation).

## 6. **Outcome Reporting**
Share the study results with the participants and the wider biohacker community. Encourage discussions and further research to refine the intervention and improve its effectiveness in promoting longevity. Aggregate analysis of results can be auto-generated and published in the [Journal of Citizen Science](https://studies.curedao.org/variables).

## 7. **Data Sharing**
Share the collected data and findings with the broader aging research community. This will facilitate collaboration and accelerate scientific progress in the field of longevity research.  Data can either be exported on the [settings page](https://app.curedao.org/app/public/#/app/settings) or in the Variable Settings page so that individuals can share it.

# Ethical Considerations ðŸ™„

Ensure that the study adheres to ethical guidelines and protects the privacy of the participants. Obtain informed consent from all participants and provide them with the option to withdraw from the study at any time. Store the collected data securely and anonymize it before sharing with other researchers or publishing the results.

# Limitations and Future Directions 

This experimental protocol provides a starting point for crowdsourcing longevity research. However, it is essential to consider the limitations of the study, such as the potential for selection bias, self-reporting inaccuracies, and adherence to the intervention. Future research should focus on refining the intervention, exploring additional data collection methods, and expanding the target population to include a more diverse group of participants.
