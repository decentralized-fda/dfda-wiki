<p>Any positive contributions are compensated by CureDAO to maximize contributions for sustainable growth.</p>
<p>To ensure this, we, currently, have a temporary token "PCUREDAO" on the Polygon chain. The "Polygon" tokens are used to track contributions prior to the genesis auction of our tangible token. Then, after the public genesis auction, 10% of the actual tokens are distributed to pre-genesis token holders proportionally.</p>
<p>Ideally, we want to incentivize the long-term alignment of the project. Thus, if one is paid in CureDAO tokens, the compensation is double the amount of other tokens. Additionally, payment in CureDAO tokens includes a 1-month vesting period.</p>
<p>Presently, we are using our Multisig to compensate upon completing a task.</p>
<h2>How to Determine The Value of a Task</h2>
<p>We're using ClickUp to assign the values of each task by filling in specific fields.</p>
<h2>When creating a task, we determine the value by:</h2>
<p>- Filling in the "Time Estimate" of the task in minutes and/or hours</p>
<p>- Setting the value of a task in “Estimated Value in dollars.”</p>
<p>- Filling in the "Importance" and "Urgency" from 1-5 of the task.</p>
<h2>The Documentation Of The Compensation</h2>
<p>Once a task is completed, the "Sent Tokens" and the "TX URL" fields are updated to reflect the compensation of the task.</p>
<p>- The "Sent Tokens" field reflects the tokens sent to the person who performed the task.</p>
<p>- The "TX URL" field includes the token transaction URL.</p>
