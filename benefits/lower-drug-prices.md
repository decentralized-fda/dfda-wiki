Below is a quantitative analysis of how drastically cheaper trials and increased competition (including off-patent/unpatentable compounds) could push drug prices down.

## 1. Why Trial Costs Drive Prices

1. **Proportion of Total Development Cost**  
   - Many estimates say Phase II/III trials can account for 50%‚Äì70% of total drug development costs.  
   - If a drug‚Äôs total development runs \$2 billion, \$1‚Äì\$1.4 billion might go to Phase II/III.  
   - A 95% cut to those trials slashes overall development costs by roughly 50%‚Äì65%.

2. **Break-Even Analysis**  
   - Firms set launch prices to recover R&D spending + overhead + profit in the patent window.  
   - Cut R&D in half, and they need far less revenue to justify the same investment return.  
   - This alone suggests brand prices can drop significantly (by 30%‚Äì50% or more).

## 2. Competitive Pressure from Many New Entrants

1. **Lower Barriers to Entry**  
   - With cheap trials, smaller companies and nonprofits can compete on niche indications.  
   - Large firms lose monopoly on data because others can afford to generate competing evidence.  
   - Result: Multiple treatments in the same market earlier, bidding down prices.

2. **Compounds That Were Never Patented**  
   - Nutraceuticals, repurposed generics, or old molecules with expired patents can now be tested cheaply in large trials.  
   - If a cheap, off-patent compound proves equal/better than a brand drug, it grabs market share quickly.  
   - Brand drug either lowers price or loses sales.

3. **Patient-Led Research**  
   - Patient advocacy groups could sponsor trials on generic or off-patent drugs to prove efficacy in certain diseases.  
   - Once proven effective, these drugs can be sold at near-generic prices.  
   - This exerts more downward pressure on new patent-protected drugs.

## 3. Modeling the Price Reduction

Below is one simple way to capture the impact:

\[
\text{New Drug Price} 
= \text{Old Price} \times \bigl( \alpha \times \frac{\text{Remaining Development Cost}}{\text{Original Development Cost}} + \beta \times \frac{1}{\text{Competition Factor}} \bigr).
\]

Where:  
- **Old Price** is the typical launch price under today‚Äôs cost structure.  
- **Remaining Development Cost** is after the 95% cut in Phase II/III.  
- **Competition Factor** accounts for the number of new competing therapies.  
- **\(\alpha, \beta\)** are weighting parameters to reflect that cost recovery and competition both matter.

### 3.1 Rough Numbers

1. **Development Cost Cut**: 50%‚Äì65% total.  
2. **Competition Factor**: Let‚Äôs say if 2‚Äì3 brand-like competitors enter a space (instead of 1), that alone can force a 20%‚Äì40% price drop.  
3. **Off-Patent Threat**: If generics or old molecules can be proven effective, price drops can exceed 50%.

Combine these effects:

- **Base Price Drop from Cost Reduction**: 30%‚Äì50%.  
- **Additional Competition Drop**: Another 20%‚Äì40%.  
- **Potential Off-Patent Competition**: Could wipe out brand share or force even deeper cuts.

Put it all together, and you might see brand drug prices drop by 40%‚Äì70% in scenarios where a generic competitor emerges early, or 30%‚Äì50% if only brand-brand competition rises. Some markets might see near-complete collapse of high brand prices if robust data prove generics or nutraceuticals are as good.

## 4. Global Impact on Drug Spending

1. **Size of the Market**: ~\$1.4 trillion/year in prescription drug spending globally (90% CI: \$1.2‚Äì\$1.6T).  
2. **Share of That Spending Potentially Exposed**: Over time, most patented drugs would face new competition (including from repurposed compounds). Let‚Äôs say 60%‚Äì80% of spending is on branded, patent-protected products.  

### 4.1 Moderate Scenario

- Assume half of that brand spending sees a 40% price reduction within a few years.  
- That‚Äôs 0.5 √ó (0.60 √ó \$1.4T) = \$420B in brand sales exposed, cut by 40% = \$168B saved.  
- Some portion of the other half might see smaller reductions. Possibly \$50‚Äì\$100B more.  
- Total savings could be **\$200‚Äì\$300B**.

### 4.2 Aggressive Scenario

- Over 10‚Äì15 years, nearly all brand sales (60%‚Äì80% of \$1.4T) face 50%+ cuts from cheap trial-based competition and cost-based pricing.  
- That‚Äôs \$840B ‚Äì \$1.12T of brand spending.  
- A 50% price drop yields **\$420‚Äì\$560B** annual savings, possibly more if many older molecules come back in.  
- Factor in extremely cheap generics or nutraceuticals that get validated, and you could see bigger reductions.

## 5. Putting It All Together

1. **Trial Cost Savings**: \$45‚Äì\$840B (wide range; baseline ~\$266B).  
2. **Earlier Access & Better Matching**: \$20B to \$20T in QALY value (baseline ~\$840B).  
3. **Drug Price Reductions**:  
   - **Moderate**: \$200‚Äì\$300B after widespread adoption.  
   - **Aggressive**: \$400B+ once off-patent competition fully ramps up.  

Combine these, and we still get a **trillion-plus** annual global benefit in many scenarios. The biggest ‚Äúwild card‚Äù is whether widespread, low-cost trials for off-patent/unpatentable compounds truly scale up. If they do, brand prices could plummet even more than the 30‚Äì50% from cost savings alone.

## 6. Conclusion

- **At Least Half of Development Costs** come from big Phase II/III trials. Slashing those by 95% reduces overall R&D spending by ~50‚Äì65%.  
- **Big Price Drops** follow because companies no longer need massive profit margins to recoup huge investments.  
- **Increased Competition** from new entrants, generic repurposing, and patient-led trials on old compounds drives prices down further.  
- **Modeling** a 30‚Äì70% cut in brand prices is plausible, translating into **hundreds of billions** in annual savings, potentially more over time.
