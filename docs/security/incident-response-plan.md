# Incident Response Plan

**Status:** DRAFT
**Version:** 0.1

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the plan for responding to security incidents related to the FDA.gov v2 Platform. The primary goals are to detect, respond to, and recover from incidents in a timely manner, while minimizing impact and preserving evidence.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

* **Security Incident Response Team (SIRT):** A designated team of individuals responsible for coordinating the incident response.
* **Technical Steering Committee (TSC):** Provides oversight and receives reports from the SIRT.
* **FDA Chief Scientist:** The ultimate point of contact for major incidents.

## 3. Incident Response Phases

The incident response process follows the NIST framework:

1. **Preparation:** Ongoing activities such as training, tool acquisition, and plan maintenance.
2. **Detection & Analysis:** Identifying and validating a security incident.
3. **Containment:** Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication & Recovery:** Removing the root cause and restoring systems to a secure state.
5. **Post-Incident Activity:** Documenting the incident, conducting a lessons-learned review, and improving security controls.

## 4. Communication Plan

A detailed communication plan will be developed to ensure timely and accurate information is shared with internal stakeholders, the TSC, relevant authorities, and the public, as required.
