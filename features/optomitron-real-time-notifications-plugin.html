<p>A half-billion people suffer from autoimmune diseases like Crone's disease, psoriasis, and Fibromyalgia. There‚Äôs also a great deal of mounting evidence that treatment-resistant depression and other mental illnesses are strongly related to immune dysregulation. What all these diseases have in common is that they can be exacerbated or improved by hundreds of factors in daily life.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/img/inflammation-factors.PNG" alt="inflammation factors"></figure>
<p>Probably the most significant is the 3 pounds of thousands of chemicals that we consume every day through our diets. Since the thousands of chemicals in our food have been GRAS or ‚ÄúGenerally Recognized as Safe‚Äù by the FDA, there‚Äôs no incentive to do research.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/img/how-much-we-know.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>We've built a connector framework that imports data on diet, physical activity, sleep, social interaction, environmental factors, symptom severity, vital signs, and others.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/img/optomitron-diagram.PNG" alt="optomitron diagram"></figure>
<p>Then we apply pharmacokinetic predictive analysis that accounts for onset delays and durations of action. This enables her to obtain personalized effectiveness values (similar to recommended daily values) for treatments and reveal potential root causes of chronic conditions.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the results obtained from quasi-experimental techniques and observational data is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the data. To maximize the amount of available data, we're currently creating a decentralized autonomous organization called CureDAO. Its mission is to create an open-source platform for crowd-sourced clinical research. It incentivizes collaboration and data sharing by competing entities by issuing non-fungible tokens to any contributor of intellectual property or data.</p>
<p>Contributors of data and intellectual property will receive ongoing royalties for their contributions linked to their non-fungible tokens.</p>
<h1>Longevitron: A Real-Life Robot Programmed to Maximize Health and Happiness</h1>
<p>Opening an app to record your symptoms, diet, or treatment sucks. Our dream is to turn this web-based robot into a physical reality. &nbsp;Longevitron is a robot that can follow you around and reminds you to take your medication, what and when to eat, track your symptoms, and even contribute your data to clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking at various implementation options here, but Loona below is an example of one such robot that could include such functionality. Loona has visual and auditory emotion recognition and speech recognition that allows you to converse with AI large language models such as ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Predictive Control Models for Personalized Health Optimization</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong></h3>
<p>Longevitron collects data on various factors that can influence your health, from your diet and exercise habits to your sleep patterns and stress levels. It also asks for patient-reported outcomes, such as how you're feeling and any symptoms you're experiencing.</p>
<h3><strong>Adaptive Intervention and Predictive Control Models</strong></h3>
<p>This data is fed into a predictive control model system, a concept borrowed from behavioral medicine and control systems engineering. This system uses the data to continually refine its suggestions, helping you optimize your health and well-being.</p>
<p>Adaptive intervention is a strategy used in behavioral medicine to create individually tailored strategies for the prevention and treatment of chronic disorders. It involves intensive measurement and frequent decision-making over time, allowing the intervention to adapt to the individual's needs.</p>
<p>Predictive control models are a control system that uses data to predict future outcomes and adjust actions accordingly. In the context of Longevitron, this means using the data it collects to predict your future health outcomes and adjust its suggestions to optimize your health.</p>

<h3><strong>Real-Life Application and Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>Consider a hypothetical scenario where you're dealing with a chronic condition like fibromyalgia. Longevitron would collect data on your symptoms, medication intake, stress levels, sleep quality, and other relevant factors. It would then feed this data into its predictive control model system, which would use it to predict your future symptoms and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.</p>
<p>This could involve suggesting changes to your medication dosage, recommending lifestyle changes, or even alerting your healthcare provider if it detects a potential issue. The goal is to optimize your health and well-being based on your needs and circumstances.</p>
<h2><strong>Longevitron: Overcoming the Bottleneck in Personalized Preventative Medicine</strong></h2>
<p>The future of personalized preventative medicine hinges on the ability to collect high-frequency data on diet, lifestyle, and medical interventions. This data is crucial for causal inference, which is the process of determining the cause-and-effect relationships that drive individual health outcomes. However, collecting this data has been a significant bottleneck in the field.</p>
<h2><strong>Passive and Active Data Collection</strong></h2>
<p>The future of personalized preventative medicine depends on the ability to collect high-frequency data on diet, lifestyle, and medical interventions. This data is crucial for causal inference, which is the process of determining the cause-and-effect relationships that drive individual health outcomes. However, collecting this data has been a significant bottleneck in the field.</p>
<h3><strong>The Power of Passive Data Collection</strong></h3>
<p>Various sensors allow it to collect data passively on various health-related factors. For example, it could use&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>motion sensors to track your physical activity levels</li>
  <li>environmental sensors, such as this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-lab-artificial-nose">electronic nose</a>, to<ol>
      <li>monitor the air quality in your home</li>
      <li>potentially record diet from the odor of foods</li>
      <li>possibly detect body odors associated with specific states of health</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br>This passive data collection is done continuously and unobtrusively, providing a wealth of information without requiring any effort.</p>
<h3><strong>Active Data Collection and Interaction</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to passive data collection, Longevitron actively interacts with you to gather more detailed information. For instance, it could ask you</p>
<ol>
  <li>what you ate or drank whenever you walked into the kitchen</li>
  <li>remind you to exercise or ask you if you completed your exercise</li>
  <li>remind you to take your medicine and ask if you've taken it</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Gut Microbiome Health and Water Intake</strong></p>
<p>Longevitron could also ask you to describe your bowel movements or urine hue, as these can be major health indicators. The Bristol stool form scale (BSFS), which categorizes the form of stool, can be used as an assessment tool for the diagnosis of various bowel diseases or evaluation of treatment efficacy.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Overcoming the Bottleneck in Personalized Preventative Medicine</strong></h3>
<p>By combining passive and active data collection, Longevitron overcomes the bottleneck in personalized preventative medicine. It collects high-frequency data on diet, lifestyle, and medical interventions, enabling causal inference on an individual level. This allows Longevitron to determine the cause-and-effect relationships that drive individual health outcomes and use this information to provide personalized health recommendations.</p>
