## TITLE I — SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS

### SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the **"Right‑to‑Trial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025."**

### SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

1.  Less than **10 percent** of U.S. patients enroll in interventional clinical trials;\[1] distance, eligibility restrictions, and direct costs are principal barriers.
2.  Median per‑patient cost for a phase‑3 drug trial in 2024 exceeded **\$43,000**\[2], inflating drug prices and limiting R‑&‑D on unpatentable therapies.
3.  The U.K. **RECOVERY** pragmatic trial enrolled 49,000 patients in 100 days at roughly **\$500 per patient**\[3], demonstrating 90 percent cost reduction via adaptive, decentralized design.
4.  Publicly financed, algorithm-targeted discounts on patient-borne trial participation costs, aimed at maximizing **quality‑adjusted life‑years (QALYs) per federal dollar**, can enhance access to trials, with patients covering the net costs of their participation.
5.  A single, open‑source **FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform**—with e‑protocol builders, liability‑insurance bidding, blockchain custody, and AI‑ranked treatment lists—will empower individuals to participate in the scientific process and enable any willing patient to join a trial of the most‑promising therapy for their condition.
6.  A transparent, open-access platform for trial design, recruitment, data submission, and cost disclosure, as envisioned by the FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform, is anticipated to foster a competitive environment among trial sponsors, further incentivizing the adoption of cost-efficient methodologies and transparent pricing for trial operations.
7.  Modernizing FDA regulation to embrace real‑world evidence, remote monitoring, and validated non‑animal test methods will accelerate safe cures.
8.  A primary objective of this Act is to achieve a minimum **80X reduction** in the per-patient cost of food and drug trials through the implementation of the dFDA Platform, enabling the comprehensive quantification of all effects of all foods and drugs.
9.  A key goal is to empower any individual or entity, not just traditional research institutions, to design and conduct valid scientific trials easily and affordably.
10. By transforming fda.gov into an open, decentralized platform, the United States can create a global public good that accelerates medical progress for all of humanity.

### SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act—

1.  **Secretary** means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
2.  **FDA** means the Food and Drug Administration.
3.  **NIH** means the National Institutes of Health.
4.  **Pragmatic decentralized trial** means a clinical study integrated into routine care, allowing remote or local data capture, minimal exclusions, and broad patient demographics.
5.  **QALY** means a quality‑adjusted life‑year, one year of life in perfect health.
6.  **FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform (the "Platform")** means the decentralized, open-source, algorithmic, and automated trial platform established on the fda.gov domain as described in this Act, designed to operate without central control by any single entity and to ensure data integrity, transparency, and resilience.
7.  **Trial Creator** means any individual, institution, or entity that designs, initiates, and manages a trial on the Platform.

(e) **Open API & Interoperability.** All de‑identified data shall be exposed through a RESTful API that is HL7 FHIR‑R5 compliant and meets 42 U.S.C. § 300jj‑52. Third‑party apps may integrate via OAuth 2.0 consent.
(f) **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).** The Secretary shall maintain automated unit‑test, security‑scan, and code‑quality pipelines that must pass before any code merge. CI results shall be publicly viewable and the Platform shall maintain compliance with **FedRAMP‑Moderate\[6]** and **NIST SP 800‑218** DevSecOps guidelines; the System Security Plan and Authority‑to‑Operate letter shall be posted in redacted form.
(g) **AI-Augmented Governance & Pull‑Request Acceptance.**
 (1) **AI-Assisted Review.** All pull requests (PRs) submitted to the public repository shall undergo an automated, comprehensive review by one or more designated AI Governance and Security Review systems. These systems shall be open-source and trained to perform deep code analysis, identify potential vulnerabilities, assess compliance with architectural standards, and model the risk of economic exploits.
 (2) **Risk-Based Triage.** The AI Reviewer shall assign each PR a risk score (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High," "Critical"). This score determines the review and merge process:
     (A) **Low-Risk PRs:** Shall be merged automatically within 72 hours if they pass all CI tests, unless a TSC member manually flags it for review.
     (B) **Medium-Risk PRs:** Shall be automatically paused and require an explicit simple majority approval vote from the TSC for merger.
     (C) **High-Risk or Critical-Risk PRs:** Shall be automatically rejected and may not be merged without a two-thirds supermajority vote from the TSC to override the AI's finding, accompanied by a published justification.
 (3) **Technical Steering Committee (TSC).** A nine‑member TSC is hereby established to oversee the repository, adjudicate flagged PRs, and manage the AI Governance Reviewers. Composition: 3 FDA officials, 1 NIH representative, 1 patient‑advocacy representative, 1 open‑source AI/ML security expert elected by contributors, 1 biostatistician, 1 cyber‑security expert, and 1 industry sponsor representative.
 (4) **Appeal and Manual Override.** Any contributor may appeal an AI rejection or TSC decision to the FDA Chief Scientist, who must respond within 30 days. The TSC retains the authority to manually re-classify any PR with a two-thirds vote.
 (5) **Democratic Renewal.** The community-elected AI/ML security expert and patient-advocate seats are subject to annual election by contributors (defined as those with ≥5 merged PRs in the preceding year) using ranked‑choice voting via a transparent, verifiable online ballot.
(h) **Rulemaking & PRA Fast‑Track.** Within 180 days the Secretary shall issue interim final rules specifying technical standards for each module, **standards for the content, format, and regular updating of Outcome Labels mandated under subsection (d)(1) of this section,** codifying the TSC charter, and **invoking 44 U.S.C. § 3507(h) such that any Information‑Collection Request[5] tied to the FDA v2 Platform obtains OMB clearance within 60 days.** Sponsors or investigators that fail to comply with these rules may be suspended under 21 U.S.C. § 331(f).

(i) **Public‑Bounty & Zero‑Knowledge Ledger.** The Secretary shall operate a continuous public bounty program—funded under § 402(a)—to reward external contributors for merged pull‑requests, vulnerability disclosures, and feature enhancements. **The AI Governance and Security Reviewer shall be used to automatically verify vulnerability submissions, score their severity, and recommend payment amounts to expedite the bounty process.** Bounties shall be posted openly as issues in the public repository with dollar amounts and paid within 30 days of merge. Furthermore, **all patient‑level transactions logged to the Blockchain Supply‑Chain Ledger shall be represented as zero‑knowledge proofs (e.g., zk‑SNARK commitments) and stored via content‑addressable storage, permitting any nation‑state or regional authority to run an independent mirror node and verify ledger integrity without accessing protected health information.**

(j) **Metrics & Transparency.** Annual public report: platform uptime, median time‑to‑trial launch, pull‑request merge rate, unresolved PR backlog, bounty payouts, penetration‑test findings, insurance‑premium benchmarks, and user‑satisfaction scores.  The Secretary shall commission an independent **penetration test** every fiscal year and publish an executive summary of findings.

(k) **Platform Intelligence and Automation.** The Platform shall leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to enhance its functionalities, including but not limited to: (1) assisting sponsors with automated protocol validation checks during e-protocol building; (2) improving the precision of matching patients to suitable trials based on their comprehensive health data; (3) augmenting the analysis of aggregated, de-identified data for early safety signal detection and pharmacovigilance; (4) **powering the AI Governance and Security Reviewer for automated code review, vulnerability detection, and pull-request adjudication as specified in subsection (g);** and (5) supporting regulatory staff with tools for efficient data review where appropriate. All such AI/ML systems shall be developed with robust validation, transparency in function, and operate under human oversight, particularly for critical decision support.

(l) **Global Accessibility.** To facilitate global participation and data collection, the Platform's user interfaces for patients and trial creators shall be made accessible in multiple languages.

### SEC. 205. FDA-X PRIZE.

(a) **Establishment.** To accelerate the development of the FDA.gov v2 Platform, the Secretary is authorized to establish an "FDA-X Prize" competition, with a prize purse to be determined by the Secretary, awarded to the entity that first develops and demonstrates a platform meeting the core requirements outlined in Section 204 and which demonstrates the capacity to achieve at least an **80X reduction** in per-patient trial costs compared to traditional methodologies.

(b) **Alternative Development Path.** The Secretary may use the prize competition as the primary mechanism for developing the platform. In such a case, the timelines and responsibilities outlined in Section 204(a) shall be adjusted to reflect a successful prize outcome.

(c) **Integration.** If the prize is awarded for a platform that meets a substantial subset of requirements, the Secretary shall ensure its integration with any components developed or procured under Section 204.

## TITLE III — UNIVERSAL TRIAL ACCESS (RIGHT‑TO‑TRIAL PROGRAM)

### SEC. 301. UNIVERSAL ELIGIBILITY FOR INVESTIGATIONAL INTERVENTIONS.

(a) **Right.** Beginning 24 months after enactment, any U.S. resident who requests an investigational intervention shall be guaranteed enrolment—remotely if necessary—in at least one pragmatic, decentralized trial arm evaluating that intervention, subject to the safety-based exclusions specified in subsection (c).

(b) **Sponsor Incentive.** The Secretary shall award a **transferable Priority‑Review Voucher (PRV)** under section 524A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to any sponsor that, on or before the universal‑enrolment activation date, opens or amends a trial on the FDA v2 Platform to accept such patient‑directed enrolment and maintains adequate investigational‑product supply. A PRV is forfeited if the sponsor later restricts patient enrolment without a documented safety or manufacturing constraint.

(c) **Safety‑Based Exclusions Only.** Sponsors or IRBs may exclude an individual patient **solely for documented, evidence‑based safety reasons** (e.g., a specific contraindication, allergy, or organ‑system risk) or if investigational‑product supply is demonstrably insufficient. Exclusion rationales must be transmitted to the FDA Dashboard within 7 days and are subject to FDA audit.

(d) **NIH Micro‑Study Fallback.** If no sponsor operates an active investigational‑new‑drug application that can accept the patient within 60 days of request, the NIH—using Other Transaction Authority—shall initiate a single‑arm or adaptive micro‑study to provide the intervention under IND and collect outcomes via the Platform; such micro‑studies qualify for subsidies under § 303.

(e) **Adaptive Enrolment.** Sponsors participating under this section must accept data‑driven lowering of exclusion criteria unless an IRB documents incremental safety risk.

### SEC. 302. PATIENT PROTECTIONS, CONSENT, AND LIABILITY.

(a) **Ethical Oversight.** All Right‑to‑Trial protocols shall undergo review by a qualified Institutional Review Board (IRB). To foster innovation and efficiency, the FDA.gov v2 Platform shall support both review by a single central IRB (per 45 CFR § 46.114[8]) and by qualified **Decentralized Ethical Review Boards (DERBs)**. The Secretary shall, through rulemaking, establish standards for the qualification, operation, and oversight of DERBs on the platform.
(b) **Informed Consent and Comprehension Verification.**
    (1) Platform e-consent shall clearly disclose, in an accessible format, the investigational nature of the trial, all known and potential risks including their likelihood based on available data (with particular emphasis on the most serious risks), the full details of patient financial responsibilities including the net cost contribution and the refundable data provision deposit (as detailed in SEC. 304), potential benefits, alternative treatments, and all data-sharing terms.
    (2) To verify genuine understanding of the disclosed information, particularly concerning the most serious risks and their likelihood, successful completion of the e-consent process shall require the patient to pass an automated, interactive comprehension quiz administered through the FDA.gov v2 Platform. This quiz shall be based directly on the information disclosed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    (3) The Secretary, through rulemaking within 12 months of enactment, shall establish standards for the development, content, validation, and administration of such comprehension quizzes, including criteria for successful completion and procedures for patients who do not initially pass. These standards shall ensure quizzes are fair, accessible, and effectively assess understanding of critical information.
    (4) Execution of the e-consent, following successful completion of the comprehension quiz, constitutes both 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization and, where applicable, a waiver of authorization under § 164.512(i)\[11] for research use of protected health information, as approved by the reviewing IRB. A record of successful quiz completion and the signed consent shall be hashed and stored on the blockchain ledger.
(c) **Safety Monitoring.** Sponsors must stream adverse‑event data to the Dashboard within 24 hours; FDA may halt enrolment under 21 CFR § 312.42.
(d) **Liability Shield.** Good‑faith compliance grants immunity from tort claims except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; mirrors Pub. L. 115‑176 § 2(c).

### SEC. 303. NIH TRIAL PARTICIPATION COST DISCOUNTS.

(a) **Fund.** A revolving Clinical Trial Patient Cost Discount Fund is hereby established within the Treasury, authorized to receive \$2 billion for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2030.

(b) **Discount Allocation Algorithm.** The NIH Director shall develop, publish, and annually recompute a transparent, open-source optimisation model for the allocation of discounts from the Fund. This model shall determine the percentage or amount of discount applicable to patient-borne costs for participation in specific trials available on the FDA v2 Platform. The primary objectives for discount allocation shall be: (1) maximizing projected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per dollar of discount provided; (2) the potential for significant healthcare system cost savings attributable to the research; and (3) the marginal scientific value of the research, including its potential to reduce uncertainty for interventions with limited existing evidence but high potential impact. The algorithm shall dynamically incorporate new evidence on treatment efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness generated through the FDA v2 Platform.

(c) **Application of Discounts.** Upon a patient's enrolment in a trial via the FDA v2 Platform, the NIH shall authorize the application of the algorithmically determined discount to the patient's share of trial participation costs, as itemized by the sponsor and displayed on the Platform (per SEC. 204(c)(3) and SEC. 304). The Fund shall cover the discounted portion of such costs. Sponsors shall certify the full, itemized costs of participation and submit all required trial outcome data for continued eligibility to have their trials included in the discount program.

(d) **Audit.** The Comptroller General of the United States shall audit the allocation and application of discounts from the Fund biennially and report findings to Congress. The Secretary may recoup any funds associated with discounts applied to mis-certified costs or for trials not meeting data submission requirements.

### SEC. 304. PATIENT COST CONTRIBUTION FOR TRIAL PARTICIPATION.

(a) **Determination and Disclosure of Participation Costs.** Prior to a patient consenting to a trial, the sponsoring entity shall determine and provide to the FDA v2 Decentralized Trial Platform a comprehensive, itemized estimate of all direct costs associated with that specific patient's anticipated participation in the trial. This shall include, but not be limited to, costs of investigational product, necessary medical procedures, diagnostic tests, monitoring, and data management directly attributable to the research participant. These estimated costs, alongside the NIH-funded discount applicable under SEC. 303, and the final net cost to the patient, shall be transparently displayed to the potential participant via the Platform's Trial Cost and Discount Module (SEC. 204(c)(3)) and detailed in the e-consent form (SEC. 302(b)). This transparent disclosure of itemized costs on a centralized platform is intended to encourage competitive and efficient pricing by sponsoring entities.

(b) **Patient Net Cost Contribution.** Each participant shall be responsible for contributing the net cost of their trial participation, calculated as the estimated total direct cost of participation (as determined in subsection (a) of this section) minus the NIH-funded discount (as determined and applied under SEC. 303). The Platform shall facilitate the management of this net cost contribution.

(c) **Prohibition on Additional Charges.** Sponsors or investigating sites may not bill or charge a participant for any costs related to their trial participation beyond the final net cost contribution calculated and disclosed through the FDA v2 Platform as per subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Participants shall retain the right to terminate their participation in the trial at any time, subject to standard clinical and ethical procedures; financial obligations will be prorated based on the extent of participation and disclosed costs.

(d) **Financial Hardship Considerations.** The Secretary, in consultation with NIH, may establish guidelines or auxiliary programs to address financial hardship for patients for whom the net cost contribution, even after applicable discounts, remains a significant barrier to accessing trials deemed of high public health value or for conditions with limited alternative treatments. Such guidelines shall not obligate sponsors to cover these costs unless through separate, voluntary programs.

(e) **Refundable Data Provision Deposit.**
    (1) To incentivize the complete and timely submission of all data required by the trial protocol, each participant shall provide a refundable data provision deposit. The amount of such deposit shall be established by the Secretary through rulemaking, considering factors such as trial duration, data complexity, and the need to avoid undue financial burden on participants.
    (2) The deposit shall be collected by the FDA v2 Platform's Trial Cost, Discount, and Deposit Module (as per SEC. 204(c)(3)) at the time of e-consent.
    (3) The full deposit shall be refunded to the participant via the Platform upon certification by the trial sponsor or a designated Platform administrator that the participant has provided all protocol-required data within the specified timeframes.
    (4) Conditions for partial refund or forfeiture of the deposit due to incomplete or untimely data submission shall be detailed in the e-consent form (SEC. 302(b)) and established by the Secretary through rulemaking. Forfeited deposits may be directed to the Clinical Trial Patient Cost Discount Fund (SEC. 303) or used to offset costs incurred by data remediation efforts.
