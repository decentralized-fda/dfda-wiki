                         READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING

The Public Health Service Act (Section 308 (d)) provides that the data collected by 
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), may be used only for the purpose of health statistical reporting 
and analysis. Any effort to determine the identity of any reported case is 
prohibited by this law.


NCHS does all it can to assure that the identity of data subjects cannot be 
disclosed. All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics that might lead 
to identification, are omitted from the dataset. Any intentional identification or
 disclosure of a person or establishment violates the assurances of confidentiality 
given to the providers of the information. 


Therefore, users will:

1. Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and analysis only.
2. Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered 
inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any such discovery.
3. Not link this dataset with individually identifiable data from other NCHS or non-NCHS datasets.

         BY USING THESE DATA, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT TO COMPLY

This CD-ROM contains the 1979-2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey Multi-Year Datafiles.  

Four separate files, all in ASCII format, are included, one containing records for 
newborn infants, only, for all years from 1979 through 2007, and three files 
separating records for non-newborns in to those for the 1979 through 1989 data 
years,1990 through 1999  data years and 2000 through 2007 data years. 


The data file documentation is provided in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.  
NOTE: You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader software to view this file. 
The Reader software can be downloaded for free from: 
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html.


Also provided in PDF format are the ICD-9-CM Addenda from 1986-2006 which are 
summarized in the Conversion Table, as well as two medical abstract forms (HDS-1), 
one used for data abstraction in 2001, and the other in 2007.


To accompany Appendices B and E of the documentation, there are several EXCEL files,
which contain information needed to calculate relative standard errors (RSEs) of
NHDS statistics and to compute utilization rates based on Census population 
estimates.  According to their contents, these files reside in directories named
 either RSES or POPS. 

                         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAUTION - BECAUSE THE NHDS IS A SAMPLE SURVEY, THE APPLICATION OF WEIGHTS 
TO THE SAMPLE DATA IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PRODUCE NATIONAL ESTIMATES OF 
INPATIENT HOSPITAL UTILIZATION. 
  
                        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a list of files contained on this CD:

"NHDS7907.NEWBORN.TXT"
NHDS 1979-2007 ASCII dataset containing records for newborn infants only, for the 1979 through 2007 data years

"NHDS7989.NOTNB.TXT"
NHDS 1979-1989 ASCII dataset containing non-newborn records for the 1979 through 1989 data years only

"NHDS9099.NOTNB.TXT"
NHDS 1990-1999 ASCII dataset containing non-newborn records for the 1990 through 1999 data years only

"NHDS0007.NOTNB.TXT"
NHDS 2000-2007 ASCII dataset containing non-newborn records for the 2000 through 2007 data years only

"NHDS MultiYear Datafile Documentation, 1979-2007.pdf"
NHDS 1979-2007 data file documentation in Adobe Acrobat PDF format

"MedicalAbstract_2001.pdf"
HDS-1 form used for abstracting medical and demographic data of sampled inpatients 
in 2001 (revised to include two new variables)

"MedicalAbstract_2007.pdf"
HDS-1 form used for abstracting medical and demographic data of sampled inpatients in 2007. 

"ICD-9-CM Addenda for 1986-2006.pdf"
This is a PDF document listing diagnosis and procedure code changes and the year they took effect, between 1986 and 2006.

"SAS_INPUT_1979-2007.txt" 
This is a SAS program to input the data file and create a working SAS dataset.  This
program is in ASCII format and can be copied or transferred to the operating system
 used to process the data.  
	
"/RSES" is a directory containing EXCEL spreadsheets of tables that include 
information needed to calculate relative standard errors (RSEs) of NHDS estimates.

These EXCEL files have parameter values for RSE curves for 1979 through 2007.  Files
are designated as XXXXRSE.xls, where XXXX is replaced by a data year between 1979 
and 2007 (e.g. 1979).  Refer to Appendix B in the data file documentation for 
instructions on how to perform RSE calculations.

"/POPS" is a directory containing EXCEL spreadsheets of tables that include 
population estimates needed to calculate hospital utilization rates by age, 
sex, and race or geographic region.

These EXCEL files have U.S. Census population estimates for 1979 through 2007. Files
are designated as XXXXRACE.xls or XXXXREG.xls, where xxxx can be replaced by a data
 year between 1979 and 2007.  The xxxxRACE files contain population estimates for 
single-year ages by sex and race.  The xxxxREG files contain population estimates 
for single-year ages by sex and geographic region.  See Appendix E for a complete 
list of these files and a more detailed explanation of their contents.
