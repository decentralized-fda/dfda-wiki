# Projects Directory

Welcome to the Projects Directory of the FDAi Community Directory. This space is dedicated to housing specific project descriptions, requirements, and collaboration opportunities that are part of the FDAi initiative. Here, you can find detailed information about ongoing and upcoming projects, as well as how you can contribute to them.

## Purpose of the Projects Directory

The Projects Directory serves as a centralized location where all stakeholders can access and contribute to the various projects under the FDAi umbrella. It is designed to:

- Provide clear and concise project descriptions.
- Outline the requirements and goals for each project.
- Facilitate collaboration between partners, researchers, healthcare providers, developers, and other stakeholders.
- Offer a platform for sharing updates and progress on projects.

## How to Navigate and Contribute

To get involved with a project or to propose a new one, please follow these steps:

1. Review the existing projects listed in this directory to find one that aligns with your interests and expertise.
2. If you wish to contribute to an existing project, check the project's specific `README.md` for contribution guidelines.
3. To propose a new project, use the template provided in `/templates/project_proposal.md` to create a structured and comprehensive proposal.
4. Submit your proposal or contribution as a pull request, and it will be reviewed according to the guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Adding or Modifying Project Content

- To add a new project, create a subfolder within this directory with a relevant name and include a `README.md` that follows the provided template.
- To modify an existing project, make changes to the relevant files within the project's subfolder and submit a pull request.

## Project Templates

Templates are available to standardize submissions and maintain consistency across the directory:

- `project_proposal.md`: A template for submitting new project proposals.
- `partner_introduction.md`: A template for partners to introduce themselves and their role in a project.

Please use these templates as a starting point for your submissions to ensure all necessary information is included.

## Staying Updated

Regular updates to the Projects Directory are crucial to keep all stakeholders informed. We encourage project leads and contributors to periodically review and update their project pages to reflect the latest developments and statuses.

## Questions and Assistance

If you have any questions or need assistance with navigating the Projects Directory, proposing a project, or making contributions, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or use the GitHub issue tracker to reach out for support.

Thank you for your contributions and for being a part of the FDAi community. Together, we can drive innovation and progress in the decentralized health regulatory space.
